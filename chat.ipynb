Luckily, its persuasive fan base (evidenced by the number of internet postings referring to the place, its wikipedia page, and the copious amounts of love letters left by patrons begging the grill to re-open) got it going again after Katrina. Power to the people! Camellia Grill was re-established in April 2007.\\n\\nTwo friends and I ate brunch here in November 2008. We waited in line about 30 minutes out front on a Saturday around noon, making conversation with other hungry New Orleanians in line who recommended the same dishes we had seen our foodie friends around town drool about. We sat on spinning stools in a curved bar formation made of marble waited on by friendly, efficient, bow-tie wearing waiters. They brought cloth napkins and marked off our individual orders onto a pre-printed worksheet with a red pen. They then fetched coffee and blended up the creamy cool chocolate freeze drinks while yelling the orders to the cooks to fry up the tastiest omelettes and burgers around.\\n\\nWe tried the Pecan Waffle, which came plain on a plate with three mini pitchers on the side filled with Cane Syrup, Maple-Flavored Corn Syrup and Liquid Butter. It was perfectly cooked, crunchy and warm all the way through. I liked that they skipped the dollop of butter or whipped cream that waffle houses usually plop on top- saving both the restaurant and patron time, money and extra Calories.\\n\\nWe also tried the Chef\\'s Special Omelette: a monstrous one with potatoes and onions inside, topped with a lot of chili (with turkey bacon, beans, ham and beef) and two types of cheese, with french fries on the side. That was tasty! Enough said!\\n\\nThe Chocolate Freeze Drink (a chocolate frappe with chopped ice) was sweet and delicious, reminding me of thick chocolate milk with crushed ice in it.\\n\\nAfter eating, we took our individual forms and paid at the cash register by the door  (by cash or credit card), again saving the waiters and patrons time. This place knows how to do it. The only problem with Camellia Grill is that we didn\\'t allow our food to settle. That was it though, everything was delicious and pleasant.   \\n\\nSee my post on the fresh dish dot com for accompanying photos and a recipe for the chefs special omelette.'}),\n",

The patties had a nice taste and dressing options for the burger were plenty with fresh vegetables. The fries and onion rings were exceptional.

Definitely the type of place I bring friends and family to when they come to visit. As locals, me and my family go there every time were in the area.  It's my favorite place to eat because the atmosphere, the service, and the food. When we walk in the door I feel like I'm stepping back in time to an old time diner.  The set-up is just one long counter surrounding the grills and it's decorated like were back in the 50's. The servers wear white dress shirts with bow ties like you expect to see in a diner. It has a vintage feel.  It's the time of place that the waiters call out your order to the back using diner lingo and they are always so friendly. If you don't know what to get they are always open to giving suggestions on classic favorites. They are perfect for late night, early morning, lunch, and dinner. They have breakfast food and a good variety of burgers and sandwiches. The food is cooked right in front of you, however you like it. I would recommend this place to locals and tourist.
