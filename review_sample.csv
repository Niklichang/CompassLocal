0,QEkyAdsrVo7tEsANDN7O9g,Missed Marvin this time around. Really enjoyed the chocolate shake. Went later in the day than I normally had in the past. Best time to go is as soon as they open. If you're lucky enough to catch Marvin working then you're in for a treat! He's definitely entertaining!
1,kIViMGM4JTHHozAE1r9boA,"best breakfast ive had in a very long time. ive been very disappointed with breakfast, maybe its just me. thats why cammellias was so amazing i had the omelet on the bottom of the menu maybe camellia, chef  or something. so good! my brother had the mexican which was also very tasty. then we had a pecan omelet and that my friends is to die for. its thinner than most which i really enjoyed, get you order in asap they get busy. the service however is very personable and awesome."
2,LpHt30LaQHAtBs-j_EYUUw,I recently visited the new French Quarter location and enjoyed it as much as the Carrollton location. Make sure you get the Manhattan Omelette. To die for!
3,WqCjrz_fV-n6y_nDxme2lA,"This is one of my favorite places anywhere! If I was told I would have to eat at Camillia Grill for the rest of my life, I might be okay with it. I'd be 400 pounds ...but I'd be happy.

Whatever Marvin is on, I want some of it. He is high energy, fun and gives awesome service! The waitstaff is half the fun of this place.

The food is awesome. It is one of the best breakfast places in the world. I have only eaten breakfast here but my wife said her corned beef sandwich was the best she ever had. When you order pancakes and you can pour the butter onto them prior to pouring syrup on, it's just...well...insert superlative here!

There is usually a wait but it is well worth it. I could go on and on but suffice to say this is a New Orleans landmark that is as good, if not better than advertised.

Huge smiley face!"
4,J8kc5pwyAtpl1Wm91RopYQ,"A total disappointment. Long time New Orleanians will recall the spotless venue, professional friendly staff. Now, the place is filthy, rundown, with stained napkins, rusted equipment, and the 'white' outfits of the staff are stained, dirty and frankly disgusting. The staff clowned around among themselves, making loud obnoxious noises.

Worse, the food was greasy, as they now have succumbed to the 'yellow substance in a bottle that is not butter' to squirt on everything, and imitation cheese for the omelettes. 

Top it off with a surly person at the register and you've had a uniformly terrible meal.

To say that Camellia Grill is a shadow of what it once was is a compliment. Its  worse than a Dot's diner or Waffle house now. It needs a complete renovation, and a newly trained staff. Sad..."
5,Eb8qupWiFGi_OU-E-NbB1A,"As far as diners go, you just don't get much better than this. Worth the wait, great staff behind the counter. A regular spot for us to visit when in the Big Easy."
6,qeRvtq8AcZATC-BE8tChFg,This place was great food and entertainment all in one. Our waiter Ronald was so fun. My friends and I all loved our breakfast. A great place to start the day in New Orleans.
7,kgBV2kR1LQ-LQqpI71qHxQ,"One of my co workers brother recommended this place to us and it was absolutely amazing.

We were in NOLA for Essence Music Festival and looking for somewhere to have breakfast, we called Eddie, a renowned NOLA taxi cab driver, and he drove us up scenic and beautiful St. Charles street to get to Camellia's.

There was a little bit of a line but we didn't mind waiting, especially once we realized we could get Mimosas to go at the bar next door to ease the pain of waiting in line. 

The hostess was friendly and welcoming but the waiters behind the counter are all top notch. We got there a little after 11am and they only have grits until 11am but our waiter scraped what he could out of the pan to give me a taster and although I did not want to I shared it with my girls, one of whom does not like grits but when I say these grits were creamy and cooked to perfection, they just melted in your mouth.

We ordered pancakes as an appetizer because we are just greedy and they were the best pancakes ever, they were so buttery and fluffy, hmm so so good!!

I had a bacon omelet which I think had a pound of bacon in it, but I had them add spinach to balance it out ;).

My friends both had omelets I think, one with chili on it and I think she died and went to heaven, they also gave me a taster of the chili for my omelet, who woulda thunk to put chili on an omelet??? It was amazing!!!

Two of the waiters have been there for over 20 years and they were super nice and full of compliments for us, they were good for our egos!!

This place is amazing, the food was so good and the atmosphere makes you feel like you are family."
8,mTvtpfqo-h0FRwId5ByRYg,"Went in for breakfast. The food was fine. The service from the server was awful. The cook was entertaining and wonderful. I would say it was a good place to go just for the experience. The kids had fun. The high chair can fit over the stools, allowing the littlest to be at the table. 

I ordered an egg sandwich and hash browns. Was basic diner food. The kids got waffles and they were basically just pancakes with texture. 

Jeremy went with Mexican omelette. It was fine he said. He loves pecans, so he ordered the pie. He liked it.  Was best part of meal."
9,R6fuc7koJeRn5K_a-U4gmA,"A highlight of our trip to NO. Amazingly friendly staff (Brun made us feel like family immediately) in a rare, old school diner environment. Do not leave without trying the pecan pie. I try not to eat dessert, but this is pecan pie is famous for a reason and worth the calories."
10,GmP59dlSHgHPm7Pzj_6FrA,Terrific hamburgers and pecan pie. Great service and atmosphere for a reasonable price. Well worth the wait
11,VZ0BKNuFgIdDphAh-vWqbg,"Camellia grill. Easy enough review. This place is not going to wow you with extravagance or anything, but if you want cheap, down-home food, go here.

I got the pecan waffle (10/10) eggs (6/10 - the whites weren't cooked enough) and ham (7/10? How does one properly judge a ham?). The buttery syrup was fantastic. Everything was good. 

The atmosphere is what sets this place apart, really. The waiters are working there, but are they really working? The large African American man who was our waiter was working IT, I'll tell you that. Some large African American lady came in and he put some sweet moves on this lady right in front of our eyes. I've never been so ready to eat in my life watching this display. Incredible experience.

So yeah, come to camellia grill. It's worth your time."
12,_Fv2XpeQdNWnSasvOvVohw,"Always one of our favorite stops when in NOLA. The wait is worth it, and yes there is always a line. But this is the place for a great diner experience. The burgers are great, the fried mac and cheese bites fantastic and the Camila Special was huge and good. But the cooks and servers are part of the main attraction. Love this place."
13,Y5SlkD5reibzJDb8kbCpJA,The Camellia Grill was fantastic! Went there when I was craving breakfast food kind of late at night. My server was super friendly and struck up a conversation with us and was really helpful and patient. I got the 2 eggs with hash browns and it was delicious. Will go back.
14,HTGF-bz7vhhA6sQp3NG-kA,"Great place and a true original little gem. I love the service when in Nola I always make an effort to stop by here. The specials of the day are always a good bet, can't go wrong with a waffles and a chop or plainly red beans and rice with a side of meat."
15,eIDLQtaLnyRqVgEQNsUB5A,My group took the Streetcar down and had lunch here. What a great place. It's a diner. We had to wait about 20 min with locals who said it was worth it. We all had burgers which were great and quick. Go to the bathroom while you are there. sits an experience and I'll leave it at that. Burger and sweet tea were around $10. We all enjoyed our food and the food around us looked excellent. if you're anal about cleanliness you might have an issue. The food is prepared in front of you and the staff is lively and funny.
16,wST7t24pSfbetzRvm6mx7A,Breakfast was well worth it. And yes the servers were hilariois. If I had to give a negative it would be the hostess. She had headphones on and texted while we stood there. She nodded where we were to sit. Management should replace her immediately. I really enjoyed the experience overall. Worth the ride over.
17,2BCg5wJWo5GZ3XeCL0bEtA,Great old diner!! Great atmosphere and friendly service. Typical dinner food which comes up pretty quickly.
18,Ik3uMbfMqeqpD-xNy25RbA,"I love the double U-shape seating arrangement when you first walk in because it's like the classic diner style with the matching servers that can sing and cook for you with a smile on their face. The food was just incredible from the fresh squeezed orange juice to the delicious made to order omelets, waffles and pancakes. Since we'd been eating nothing but fried foods since our visit I opted for the healthy omelet with fresh fruit as a side instead of hash brown which I was told was just incredible."
19,Bfy3GZYgvRaDmwkamb0J5Q,"Don't judge this book by its cover! And definitely get the Southern food menu items (versus getting their burger options you can get anywhere). All-day breakfast (LOVE), delicious shake flavors, and open late. Service could not have been better & we even met some friendly locals. Was amazed to find out the place had been there since 1946. There's a reason they're still around. If you're Uptown, try this place!"
20,Tmg23-TKzaI8RrGz4pVmAA,"The staff is attentive and a little abrupt, but that's just part of the experience at Camellia's Grill.  It's fun to listen to the unusual lingo that the cooks shout to communicate the customers orders to each other.  The burgers are to die for!  It was hot and had just the right amount of seasoning and fresh toppings.  These are the best burgers in the area and very reasonably priced.  We will definitely be back the next time we are in New Orleans!"
21,hpc9hWgqWl-Mx5Pwb6On1A,"I never understood what ""light and fluffy"" eggs were until I ate here. Apparently they put pancake batter and use a whipper to whip the eggs to get them so light and fluffy. BEST BREAKFAST I've ever had anywhere, hands down. Their omelettes are above and beyond any other i've had. A MUST try.

This place is a diner in a an old southern structure. Had the chefs special. A bargain at $8. Huge and filled with turkey bacon, onions 2 cheeses, bacon, ham, french fries (u read that right) and topped with chili (u read that right again). Served with toast and ur choice of french fries, hash browns, or grits. Had the hash browns, which looked like ur everyday fresh hash browns, but they must either deep fry it or put crack in it cuz its some of the most flavorful ordinary looking hash browns i've had. Went back and had their pecan waffle, which wasn't bad, but wasn't great. Their fries were definitely above average. Mexican omellete was really good too. Their western omellete is the best i've ever had. No exaggeration.

Service is super friendly and fast. Food is delicious. Prices are very fair. 

Only one drawback: my new years resolution of losing weight went completely down the drain."
22,peC35r9sMcjX0dvCpgQv-g,"Great diner experience. The french fry omelette was.... interesting. This place isn't the best greasy spoon you will visit, but it's definitely one of the coolest ones. There's a historic feel to it, and the service is unbelievable. Just be smart and avoid peak times, even though the line moves somewhat quickly enough. Expect to rub elbows with people, as you're all seated at the counter. 

Burgers are good, chili is decent, waffles are good, omelettes are okay. I can't speak for much else here, but all in all you should give it a go at least once. 

If you're a tourist staying in the French Quarter, this place is accessible by streetcar, just take the St. Charles line all the way down, it's a gorgeous ride. When you hit a 90-degree corner, after passing Audubon Park and Loyola, you've hit Carrolton, and you'll need to get off there. You'll see Cameliia Grill from the corner, and don't be put off by the line, it moves fairly quick."
23,tMESSwaI19TSjN-9N5NBkg,"Just went there for the first time in 40 years. The food was great and the freezes wonderful. The chocolate freeze was made with good ice cream and real Hershey's syrup. The burgers, grilled cheese, ham , french fries and chicken tenders are very good. It is a good family place to visit. It is counter service only which I had forgotten. Hope to get back again."
24,GqoV3TutjHp5gwyIOl7JBQ,"I live a few blocks away from this place... if I wake up early enough and can get there before 9, it's a quick stop for breakfast. The food comes out very quickly, even if it's busy. The food is definitely not the healthiest. So healthy freaks, stay away. Their chocolate freezes are very good. I take one on my way to work sometimes. They put hasbrowns on they menu somewhat recently, so I was happy about that. They're famous for their grits, I think. 

I like the ambience... it's very old school New Orleans and I like that. The servers play the role pretty well - calling out orders and carrying that NOLA swag, if you know what I mean. Marvin and Ray are so kind and make you laugh. They like to converse with their guests and I like that. For out-of-towners, this is a cool place, mainly for the experience. 

If you're not from here, you should at least try it. Just get there early."
25,Qxq2aXH9GkMz7-Zg5RGFvQ,"Great prices, great food, great service. Went back twice for breakfast! Had awesome conversation with other visitors at the counter, also had great talks with the staff. Overall excellent time."
26,gk-fmydqtLbdLTs1lP-4LQ,"Well...this is my 50th review on Yelp. And I wouldn't have wanted it to be with any other place. 
The Camellia Grill was the first place I ate in New Orleans when I came here 6 years ago. I still distinctly remember Marvin ""Word"", who was THE MAN. He sadly passed away a few months ago, RIP. 

There's a simple reason there is a line out the door every Saturday and Sunday morning. The food is incredible. You definitely have to come here hungry and get the Chef's Special Omelette. It's the best omelette I've had anywhere in the country. I also recommend the pecan waffle and the burgers. 

I like the Uptown location the most but there is a location in French Quarter as well where the food is just as good. If you don't want to wait in a really long line, I recommend coming here on a week day."
27,rRu0SYqrdMtNRcEr58mo8A,"3.75 stars.  There are two locations for the Camellia Grill, but this is the one you want to visit.  Here, you are not only getting wonderful food, but you get to do so within a stately house where the people who have been working the restaurant clearly understand the concept of customer service. Sure, the wait in line can be monumental, but when the payoff comes in an exceptionally sweet pecan pie served with a dollop of ice cream and a colossal double cheeseburger topped with an artery clogging fried egg, you've done well.  While it is only slight hyperbole to note that I was barely able to walk after ingesting all these calories, you certainly won't hear me complaining about eating here.  This is worth a stop if you are in New Orleans for a few days."
28,01wCYhk_jE8A0rn4qpMUFg,"Had a few recommendations for Camellia Grill, but it was extremely disappointing. Went for Sunday lunch, place was extremely crowded and was asked to move around multiple times to accommodate other guests. And then the food ordered was extremely subpar. One buck burger came dry and buns were cold, did not have cheese or grilled onion on it (we ordered them!!) Asked waiter to fix it, he brought back two slices of cheese........ I want them melted on my burger, or why don't i just go to walmart and buy a bulk and bring it myself to put on their dry and tastless burger?

That's not it! The service was miserable. We had to ask for water 3 times before they refilled it when we were ready to leave!

Way below expectation, won't go back there again. I'd recommend against ever going there Sunday afternoon when it's crowded."
29,62iVPi8xtjVFnikl1cIGHw,"This little diner is a must stop if you are on the Saint Charles Streetcar line.  It is nothing fancy, but you get good service and great food.  I had the vegetable omelet- it was huge!"
30,E5UGKeeiEtavgPCmL-2nug,"My daughter just graduated from Tulane so we are going to have to figure out excuses to get back to New Orleans and to Camellia.  We were there twice in 5 days because our cousin flew in from Florida and wanted to go there before our son flew in and he wanted, no, NEEDED, to get a Chili Omelette!  Best omelettes in the world, mixed up in a blender, so fluffy.  I always get grits because I can get hashbrowns in NY.  Friendly service, just a one of a kind place (haven't eaten  in the one in the quarter, why mess and this one is near Tulane.)  Bought a T-Shirt this time.  The stem of the flower is a fork.  Don't miss this when you visit New Orleans."
31,H-E3xTCrLs_CWSBAIQzogg,Love it.  Second trip to New Orleans and sad cuz the French quarter location is closed but the original is nice a trolley ride.  Great burger.
32,mA0LgVmjsmnAB4BjZN7cbw,I always have a good meal here. But the atmosphere is what takes this place to another level. Your server will be one of the friendliest servers you will have in any restaurant.
33,AJFnrxYzRLC2WPTDUq9tqw,Authentic diner experience.  Walking into the restaurant takes you back a few decades.  I ordered the red beans and rice and the pecan pie.  Both were good.  Not the best I had in New Orleans.  But the area is very nice and the ambiance is great.
34,DvXb2pjnoqjk33G13lit3A,"You go to Camellia Grill for the experience, the fist-bumping camaraderie and manic enthusiasm of the waiters and cooks, the authentically old-fashioned feel of the retro diner. The expansive menu, if the copyright date of 1985 is any indication, has long remained unchanged. No surprise, since they offer standard no-frills diner fare, ranging from fair in quality to pretty good. Remarkable food? No. Food that makes you go ""Holy crap, now this is what I call food""? Definitely not, but if you're in the mood for dependable greasy-spoon stuff, this is your go-to place. Whether you're a resident or visitor, you must go at least once."
35,BR9HR8VFjeO5YhOiCW3haw,Best cure for a hangover! Classic-greasy-Cheeseburger and omelette are just the best in town.
36,g9MZgYN7npremIiZwp_RtA,"Finally made it to Camellias grill! We ordered the bacon cheeseburger and chocolate freeze. You absolutely have to order the chocolate freeze if nothing else. It is so good, you don't want it to end. Will definitely be back"
37,33kfuGDwKIKldh3xal7_DA,"Coming here felt like coming home - except better because my mom doesn't cook this well.  Getting here was fun - an easy ride on the St. Charles streetcar - so you get a scenic tour and breakfast.  We didn't wait too long, but I can see how it would totally busy.  The food was fantastic and, oh my, buttery!  Our server was friendly and funny.  Honestly, this place set the mood for the rest of our day and it was delightful!  My husband still talks about this place even a year later."
38,CAZ61PTLoaEAVJCUjSh-DQ,"We dropped off our son the in the Loyola University area this week and stumbled upon this gem.  Excellent for breakfast, we got omelettes with hash browns.  They deep fry the sausage and that was quite a treat.  Love the service and we discovered the guys on the walls of the place have been cooking there for over 20 years!

Our waiter made us a sample size of their chocolate cherry shake...my daughter loved it!  This will be our go to place on our next visit.  Can't wait to try the grits too."
39,qopUkiBtOT8neBh_WyRmgQ,"This was my favourite place to eat during the whole of our trip to NOLA.  I loved it! 

Counter-side seating, so you get very chummy with your neighbours, our server was excellent and lots of fun, very entertaining and it's open late, which we needed after our swamp tour.  The servers just shout your order at the chef - who, in the time we were there, got it right every time.  No tickets, no pens or paper - excellent! 

Food was great and prices were reasonable.

Hubby and I shared the 'Harry's Yankee' roast beef po-boy and a large cheese fries, it was yum.  Hubby had the mocha freezee and we all came away happy! 

They must have good gumbo here, a couple came in, he ordered a Reuben, she asked for Gumbo, they'd none left so she got up and left!

Definitely somewhere to add to your list - fab!!!"
40,Y7LEN_iS_DcEWmF61rt6Gw,"Friendly staff, great food and fair prices make this a wonderful place to eat.  The breakfast fare is outstanding and the burgers are made fresh to order.  Very clean!   Check it out!"
41,jc3WFP2rcj67ij9LJUKAgw,"This place was recommended by a former NOLA resident. Definitely didn't disappoint. Basically a 50's inspired diner. The menu is pretty bare bones. A variety of breakfast and lunch options. It still has that old school diner feel to it. I had a Manhattan Omelette which had Swiss and American cheese along with Corned Beef and onions. It was Delicious. One of the fluffiest omelettes i've had in recent memory. My wife had ham and eggs which also looked excellent. Huge portions for an extremely fair price. They are a little heavy handed on the butter, but this is a diner isn't it. This place would be a great hangover joint after a night on the town. Apparently the restaurant closed due to Katrina with no plans of reopening. Their patrons covered the entire front door with notes to reopen and they did. There are pictures of the door in the restaurant. Nothing is keeping this gem down. Would definitely return. One small complaint is that there is not enough seating. They could almost accommodate twice the people with a larger location. There were people waiting for a seat the entire time we dined. And that was on a Monday afternoon. I can only imagine what a Sunday morning is like at this place!"
42,Sn1YRL_kFHmJLdgGwuNqdw,"I can't say enough about this place. I walked in one day, with a need for waffles AND a patty melt...and they made it happen. I got, what I now lovingly refer to as a ""waffle-melt,"" with a fried egg and a coke. Heaven IS REAL."
43,tTaLpr-l3PFfc3wxqIOK_Q,"We went for a late breakfast, on our last day in town, and absolutely loved it!!!  Great value for the money. My wife and I both had the pecan pancakes - they were awesome!!!  I was full off the cakes & bacon alone; and then I had to move on to the huge plate of hash browns that sat in front of me. (made to order with peppers & onions, just the way I like 'em). I loved the atmosphere here.  Reminded me of a barber shop environment!  Very friendly staff.  We found metered street parking in front of Camellia's and on the side street adjacent."
44,bQJ_ffhy-e5vD77O5Hf_vg,"This is exactly what a muffuletta is supposed to be. Cooked to perfection in front of you and placed on fresh French Bread. Absolutely the best I've had. Then the pecan pie was served hot off the grill, yes off the grill. Unbelievable how good it tastes warmed upside down on the grill with the pecans seared hot to perfection."
45,pPwyaM4a67-aQj9GcpaMlg,"Right on the St. Charles Streetcar Line, this place is a GEM!

The building is fronted by grand whitewashed columns, and doesn't look the part of a classic diner, but once inside the impressive stainless open diner-style kitchen surrounded by wide a marble bar in incredibly inviting.

The food was probably the best I've ever had at a classic American styled diner. Burger was cooked to juicy perfection, chili cheese fries were greasy good, and the Vanilla milkshake was phenom!! Wife ordered a grilled cheese and raved at the result as well.

The charismatic restaurant staff dressed in classic black bow tie diner attire were fun, if not entertaining.

I will without a doubt, come back here the next time I'm in town. I would easily say this should be highly recommended to anyone not afraid of raising their cholesterol a couple points!

(TIP: If you're staying downtown, hop on the St.Charles line for $1.25 and take it right to the front door and back)"
46,8gc020V6lV65jAFrQwcSkg,"Saying this place is a New Orleans institution is an understatement. My mom and dad used to come here when my dad was attending Tulane back in the late 1940s and early 1950s after World War 2. I used to live on St. Charles past Napoleon and I took the street car here 6 days a week for supper. That was back in the 90s. Great food, great staff and fantastic, old school New Orleans atmosphere. If you want to eat like a local come to the Grill."
47,TRnFEM5w-m-yWTggX7AJNQ,"Loved our stop in here for Memorial Day breakfast. Tasty food, friendly folks, great service in a sweet neighborhood. Try the omelets!"
48,NqrP6KFPRdKaAtDhrienLg,"Classic greasy spoon, New Orleans-style.  Small, pink, crowded, noisy, and utterly delicious.  The omelets are really fluffy--the eggs go in a milkshake blender before they hit the grill--and any breakfast there will set you up for the day, easy.  Husband, who is a grits afficianado, says their grits are some of the best ever.  Worth waiting in line, plus when you pay your bill at the end, you get a lollipop!  Word!!"
49,IoXIrvqJ59QjlRfHtsLL9w,"This place has the best classic diner feel! The staff was awesome and they treat you as if your family. It felt like eating dinner and out of town family's house. Amazing omelettes, def a must. I also recommend the Doc Brinkers Special. This double cheeseburger with slaw and chili is to die for. It will satiate the biggest of appetites. Treat yourself to a shake as well."
50,7c41AHNEAT3UpHf4zceKZQ,"Fantastic food, service was great and the atmosphere is wonderful with an old school vibe. 
I went back a few days later with a friend because it was so good! 
Try the Mexican omelette, the chef special omelette and the pecan pie."
51,XjilMpCNtewYeuJLDMrzBQ,"Great meal at reasonable prices. The burgers are great and the hash browns are even better.  Everything is cooked to order in front of you. There is an entertaining banter between wait staff and the ""chefs"".  I always enjoy stopping here for a late night meal wether it be breakfast for dinner or a burger.  I did notice that the hours have changed so not sure if there is a new owner or not.  Still have a line out the door at random hours.  May not be your typical New Orleans food but definitely a local favorite."
52,hs0tBVuKiOEcm622WYK_0A,"Very nice place that is always crowded. Food is ok but it's the service that makes it a place to explore. 

Don't come here to loose weight but rather to ""collect"" all the calories you will want to get rid off the following two weeks ;-). 

We had the scramble eggs with bacon and hash brown and a chicken-club sandwich. Tasty."
53,auiJMJFPL9ta32u9pO8wHw,"One of my favorite spots in New Orleans. The burger and the Red Beans are both delicious, and the pecan pie is insane. The servers/chefs are really what make it though. They are so fun to interact with and to watch interact with each other. The line can sometimes be long but it's very worth the wait."
54,EODALgk8nMPdpsQPE9bsPQ,Great food. Great service. Worth the wait!!  NOLA classic. Grab you some breakfast at the bar or stop by for a cold drink.
55,G5YO5dajporLG8nYWw2gDA,"2/3/12
We ate there on friday morning almost as they open for the day.  We didnt know there were no tables , but had a highchair for our daughter which was perfect. The over the top friendly service and attention to customers from every worker is hard to find anywhere , But here . The service was great , our daughter loved it .  They gave us a couples fries for her and some chocalate milk  (first time !) as we sat down . My wife had a omelet and potatoes i had a pecan waffle and some eggs . I will say the omelet was one of the best ive tried . The pecan waffle was great as well and my daughter loved her grits and eggs . We came in from STL for a couple days and will say best part of our trip was at camellia grill . If you want great diner style food this is what you want , and the guys burger looked good as well . Thanks for making our trip even better ."
56,z6RWPrj4of5XoQKzeQKbDw,"This Uptown/Carrollton tradition is still hopping after over 60 years in business. Camilla Grill is located right on the St. Charles Streetcar Line and is a easy ride for even tourists staying in the French Quarter. 

The ambiance is very diner like with the only seats being at the counter. The staff behind the counter make for great dinner entertainment. The service here is quick and very friendly. The food is a bit heavy but very good. I had the Camilla Special sandwich which may look a bit plain but full of wonderful flavor. My girlfriend had the Judge's Chicken which was a well seasoned grilled chicken breast with fresh coleslaw. The rest of our party had a burger and the catfish. The catfish was crispy, not oily, and very fresh. Make sure you have it with the hot sauce,  Crystal hot sauce yum! 

We left very full and satisfied, a great experience for our first night in New Orleans. The only minor complaint we had was the cashier and host were a bit preoccupied with their phones and personal conversation to check us out quickly."
57,9Vp7XVBA49TQpuE5jna_oQ,"A diner that doesn't open until 8am? Not good. Not good at all. That said, it's a great place. Exactly what you expect from diner food. They do it right. Wish they opened at 5 or 6."
58,4PKQCo6MbPFqgqGpZ34i5Q,"I actually love the place - 
But just don't go in the early morning hours just before closing.....you may never get your food.....and if you do it is under cooked nasty food....

Any other time I have gone, the food is outstanding, the staff is very friendly.  Waffles, omelets, hamburgers, chocolate freezie, pecan pie a la mod.....ALL MUST HAVE foods!!!!
Lagniappe, if you're lucky to catch the staff putting on a show for your entertainment.
Everytime I go and sit in the atmosphere of Camelia Grill while I'm waiting for my food - I just can't resist reminiscing about New Orleans back when .....Ah, remember this or that....."
59,gwCpoe1uCQgEHUHJ6AFpjQ,The food is American diner food with high quality. What makes it superb is Leon the waiter. He puts a great spin on the experience.
60,y5Vekvirl2INipKujUHhzg,"OK, first off let me say I love this place and have been coming here on and off for many many years. I bring out of towners here all the time. Today, my wife and I went for lunch, our waitstaff was great as always, the food was great as always, We ordered 1 hamburger, 1 hamburger poboy, 2 fries, 2 coffees, 1 ice tea and a slice of pie with a scoop of ice cream. Couldn't have been a better lunch until l I went to the cashier to check out. The total was $56.22!!! WTF? I stared at the bored looking guy behind the register, ""I'm sorry, what?"" $56.22 he said again handing me a receipt. I said ""That's impossible, show me"". He proceeded to show me our order slips the waiter filled out which had no prices on them, he then showed me our receipt, which had no prices on it and said ""Its what the computer says"" and just stared at me blankly and refused to go any further with the conversation. 

Now being an experienced New Orleans resident, I immediately think since he saw an Austin Public Library t-shirt I was wearing, he scammed me. Whether that's is true or he was just stupid and refused to go over it with me, I dont know but I got ripped off for what was more or less a $30 lunch and the cashier couldn't have cared less. That's not the Camellia Grill Ive known for 15 years."
61,Cphr5q2gY52TIqf3Fr1TvA,Fell upon this place after our trolley ride to the garden district.  Nothing fancy here but good sandwiches and grill type of food.  Had the special and could only finish 1/2. Hubby got the Ruben and said it was very good.  Great counter staff.
62,DNUSTzFEe_QfD8DQKuAoQQ,Love some Camellia Grill!  Worth the wait for some New Orleans charm and delicious food.  Great place to jump on the street car after and enjoy the city.
63,XDVbolRLpNhcQ9xwx2d7sw,"This place was so fun to eat at!  I love that it was bar style dining, and you sit facing all the action so you can watch them make your food.  Our server was so great and on point.  The whole staff was very friendly and upbeat. I got the mexican omelet with hashbrowns and it was DELICIOUS! They are very generous with their portion sizes. I also tried their chocolate cherry freeze and that was very good as well.  And holy hell, get a slice of their pecan pie. Will definitely come back.  It gets crowded quickly so i would recommend coming at an ""off"" hour rather than during the brunch and lunch rush.  But there are booths along the walls that you can sit at while you wait for an open seat amongst the bar stools!"
64,a3YO42M2JeUtSookzE7Vxw,Food was decent but nothing memorable. We had visited here a few years ago and enjoyed the entertainment from the waiters. Wait staff now don't seem to have the humor and outgoing personalities I remember from back then.
65,kVjIgpVnOFdCEv39hBYgxA,"Seating is extremely limited and the food is exactly that of a diner. I would say it's not anything super special (food wise), but obviously the cool part is that AHS was filmed here! We had to wait a while for our seats and had to be split in the group. They tried their best though to accommodate all of us. The food comes out fast and the service is good! 

I got a bacon cheeseburger with everything on it and it definitely hit my hangover spot that I needed. We also ordered the chili cheese fries and they serve a good amount of it - we couldn't finish it even sharing between 7 girls! If you ask them to do an announcement for you, they will! Super cool environment and we just had beat the rush when we were walking out there was a line out the door. Can't imagine how long people had to wait for that! Definitely great hangover food!"
66,TQBUop4a1x_-ED29dF69SQ,"I find Camelia Grill to be absurdly overrated. In a city of amazing food, this does not rank with the best. It's typical diner food and nothing more."
67,36cyXPKR9sEOCZOflq-eXQ,"My wife and I heard good things about the pecan pie, so we decided to stop in for a bite.  The place has an old diner vibe, which is pretty cool.  The service was prompt and friendly.

The pecan pie was ok, but nothing to write home about really.  They put it on the grill to warm it up.  It looked like the cook scraped the spatula he was using for the burgers on the grill, and then used it to take the pie.  I guess it's too complicated to have spatulas for each kind of food, but it kinda killed the moment for me a bit."
68,A9MtWue4pIKHG00gEPchjg,"Great environment, good food, great price, incredible service."
69,3lAut6lxBQS5K8NLatahFw,"If you're looking for a great late night run for $6 cheeseburgers that'll fill you up, this is where it's at. 

This place is great for drunk moments and late night moments. They close late and they serve all that good greasy type food. I was turnt by hand grenades at Bourbon st, and made my way here by street car. Me and my friend killed about four burgers! We should've had pie but we were stuffed. 

They take their time grilling the burgers as well so it's the real deal!"
70,4odisceByhwo0faSekYE6Q,"Just so it is no surprise, this is a small place. On a weekend, expect upwards to a 30 minute wait. You will not be seated at a table rather at a bar that wraps around the kitchen. (I'm sure this was done to maximize space and serving time) 

Food here is awesome, I have yet to have anything was not to my liking. Camellia Grill is known for their omelets, so give each one a try. The burgers are more than decent. And from the stranger sitting from my left, the desserts are more than enticing. 

As a side note, I would suggest to management that mop heads, trash, and other similar smell factors are moved far from eating areas as it can sometimes kill the fun of Camellia Grill."
71,dUwOh9xApZX2K_oEqYFEdg,Yay!  This place makes me so happy. Great old school diner with wonderful burgers and chili cheese fries. The coffee freeze put us over the top. Looking at the dishes around us I will definitely be back for an omelette and hash browns.
72,QBrwYJuy-C26olrBh9baFQ,Best meal I ate in NOLA. The Manhattan omelet was AMAZEBALLS and the hot roster beef po'boy was incredible. We got the hot pecan pie a la mode and it was heaven. We wanted to keep ordering and eating because it was so good except we felt sick from the huge portions. In a good way! Service from Gilbert was great and food came up super fast. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
73,kWcNZfMSRSCAcElQ2LrspQ,"Great old fashioned place, wonderful food, fast service, and a kind waiter. What else could you need? The line might seem intimidating at first so try not to go during peak hours, but the wait is worth it if you have the time. Must try in Nola."
74,HisAUXzhgM0sv0MOC_hV5Q,"I've been going here since I was a child, through my high school and college years. I'm 36 now and I still love it. You can't find a chocolate freeze like theirs anywhere else! I have to admit, I haven't had a ton of their menu items, because there's something so nostalgic about getting ""my usual"": cheese omelette with fries and a chocolate freeze. Of course, I've had the burger, the red beans, pancakes, and a few other staples, but that omelette is legit. This is also the best place for late night food in the city. There is usually a wait even for late night, but it's worth the wait. The staff is so friendly and they remember you every time you come in. Most of these guys have worked here for ever! I love how they yell out your order to the cook and he just remembers everything. They get it right every time!"
75,WZKDokoJoXYcvY7B0geIfg,"I wish I remembered to check in here so I never forget that I was here.. took a streetcar down St. Charles from CBD which is an adventure on its own.  If you're a tourist it's worth it to ride the streetcar once so you can look at all the surrounding architecture. but we're not here for that.. we're here for the food

My friends and I visited NOLA and camellia grill was our last stop before heading back to the airport.. Not all of us made it out but the others definitely missed out.

My friend and I ordered the waffles with sausage (YUM) and the manhattan omelet (even more YUMs).. the omelet is infused with hash browns.. the hash browns alone are delicious as well.  Our third friend ordered the standard eggs, bacon, and hash brown meal.. while we were waiting for our food we saw the guests next to us order cheeseburger and onion rings.. that's when my friend and I decided we NEEDED to get that as well.. The cheeseburger didn't even need to come dressed.. the patty, cheese, and delicious bread is all that was needed.. 

There's nothing negative to say about the food here.. especially given by the fact that we doubled our order just by looking around... and we ate it all...

Can't have a complete meal from this place without their pecan pie.. before they serve the pie to you they grill it for a few moments and of course you HAVE to get it a la mode with the vanilla ice cream on top.. its so delicious.. the bottom portion is nice in crispy while the center is still soft (perfect combo of textures)

I'm drooling."
76,zpIKr2-9uxjN18LuyIk4TA,"Great place for breakfast where the St Charles line turns north.  There was a significant wait on this very stormy morning, though I'd say it was worth it.  Omelets are fluffy and delish, and service is extremely fast.  But the real winner here to us was the ambiance and service.  The open kitchen is great to watch, the counter style seating lets you meet strangers, and the staff are oh, so nice."
77,brHUG3DFeNKlAoSRjhTjRA,"Always great!  We lucked out and arrived at the perfect time; sat right down at the counter and ordered an amazing breakfast.  This was my son's first time and he loved it, we will all be back."
78,Iapt2nCnmamauiraa_cQhg,"I heard that the place can be really busy but we must have come in at the right time because there was no wait for seating. We were told that this place is usually crowded. 

The customer service was great. We were helped right away and got our food very quickly. The gumbo was TO DIE FOR. I've had gumbo only a few times before but this by far was the best I've ever had.  If you're in the area definitely try this place out!"
79,rQc957qhZX2RTTl05Cy_SQ,"We went for breakfast. Service was tops. Hash browns were really good. We liked everything about the place. You have to sit at the counter, so if that's not your style, don't go."
80,ISwjZBtYEvxKm2-2DAf8Rw,"Always consistent on food quality!! Camellia Grill is always open, most holidays and late night. Ruben was delicious!!"
81,SHHLPq3jBpiauX-U8Mi6sQ,"Must do while in Nola-

Fist bump the jovial waiters at Camellia Grill

You will probably have to wait here but it's never for too long. This fast paced and fun diner is an experience you don't want to miss. Once you're seated your always smiling and witty waiter will quickly come over, take your drink order give you a fist bump. Fist bumps are always fun, am I right?

It's not a very roomy sort of place. You will probably hit elbows with your neighbors once you start chowing down on the great food you watched the cooks prepare behind the counter, but hey, it's a great way to meet new people. I had to apologize to my stranger neighbor so many times that I eventually got to know him and his entire family and why they were there (dropping daughter off at school after a break).

It's affordable, it's tasty and it's good dang fun. If you don't go, you aren't doing New Orleans right."
82,BE1JFbWn_oNXY1Lr_83O2A,"Camellia Grill is stellar, fantastic, life-changing... That may be a little exaggerated, but you will get your money's worth and leave feeling satisfied and happy! Camellia Grill's location is great, right in front of the street cars, Audubon Park and pretty uptown neighborhood. 
As a New Orleans born and raised, this is the first restaurant that comes into my mind when suggesting great restaurants in the area. The only downside would be that sometimes it's a wait and there can be flies. Other than that, I love Camellia. Great prices, great food, friendly staff. My favorite is the Rano's Omelette. I'll truly miss Camellia when I leave for college!"
83,NjPybXKzYDczAMbi3lGJyg,Good food and excellent  service! The veggie omelette I had was big enough to share. Busy place especially on weekends so be prepared to wait.
84,Lo4Pci2so6wUb9ZNp224Mg,"Fun Experience.

Get a fist pump from your server at the diner and you feel a bit better about the long wait in the hot, humid line outdoors, and the extended wait inside on the couches.

The people make this place hum and you can tell they like working there. Look, I've had better burgers at similar places, but you should take the trolley down past Loyola and Tulane and give this place a visit. I'd suggest before 11 a.m. on a weekend.

Diner-style, old-school seating means faster turn times and more conversation with your neighbors...just like it used to be.

The milk shakes were great and like all the food, overpriced for the quality. What you're paying for here is the experience, which is a fun time with a dash of nostalgia."
85,MLopkVjlH9DHsrirMOsveg,If you are staying in the French Quarters it can be a trip to make it out here but it's worth it. Not only can you take the trolley and see beautiful houses on the way and stroll down the Audubon park but you will have one of the best roast beef po'boys around. The line can be long at times.
86,kT7W356yKZKVGY6mOw68RQ,"Aug 23 rd was my 60th birthday. There is no other place I wanted to eat at but here!!
Mr. Michael was our waiter & all of a sudden Mr Marvin announces my birthday! They got the entire restaurant joining in singing to me! 
Then, they called me out to dance lol,
It was a blast thanks for helping my birthday be the best!!!!"
87,7t4QLuaPpYIN9Yc58tatVg,"The Manhattan omelette is exceptional. The bacon was cooked perfectly to our liking at both locations (the grill NOLA) and the original.  We thought the Manhattan at the Original location uptown was just a little bit better though.

The line at the uptown original location was so long that my friend went into the nail salon next door and got a color change of her nail polish! 

Also, if the line is long, it is just a few steps to the bar next door for a great Bloody Mary while you wait. Its a fun place, the food is great, and its a must go if you have not been."
88,8uSPw4ru2wk8sG9g3HrVlw,"I know, I know... the wait is horrific sometimes, but if you are in need of comfort food, this is the place. I love those guys behind the counter so much, I wish they were my friends in ""real life."" They make everyone smile, and I love getting to know the nice tourists sitting next to me. Mexican omelette makes my tummy happy, and I can't seem to drive by without stopping for a chocolate-cherry freeze. Calories, schmalories. Worth it!"
89,pdZkk-hUV0IL5RRhRR-Lag,If I could go zero I would . Wife and I came after the game and we got their before the wait.  Ordered 2 bacon cheese burgers fries and a tea.  We were giving 2 waters and that was it. Food came 10 minutes or so no bacon on one burger so we asked our server who must've lost a bet with the Saints cause he was miserable. . Almost done our food we tell him take off the tea and bacon and he ask us then you still want your bacon. No dude were done . So I grab my bill and go to the front door where this figure that has a title manager is standing.  I told him make sure there is no charge for a tea and bacon. He gives me my total and hands me my change.  I am pissed off I tell him you are a sorry excuse for a manager you don't apologize or anything.  Thanks for wasting my time and we will not return anytime soon. .
90,F3WDkIWBkoEAK9QWA-R0yQ,"This is historically a fun place to come on the St. Charles trolley for a cheap and tasty meal. This time the meal (pancakes) was still tasty but the service was pretty much nonexistent. We sat at the end of the counter and no one approached us for drinks or an order until my boyfriend flagged someone down. Our waiter (#519) barely made eye contact, didn't engage and pretty much made our short stay a disappointment. This place used to have a reputation for being fun and lively but the people working here today (and maybe in general, I don't know) just look like they hate their jobs. Maybe they do - dealing with tourists probably isn't fun. But damn, I'm happy to tip well for a job well done and it just wasn't here. At least the trolly ride was fun."
91,Tz3uE0Q318EmNlpVZA7Zbw,Love the fun and friendly atmosphere!!! Diner still but not missing any of the New Orleans love or cuisine. I went with the Catfish Po' Boy and also had one of their waffles! I loved it!!!  Definitely a must for anyone visiting or living in the area!
92,qOc9v1O2EpMtunCZsT5PIQ,"3.5 stars. I liked this place...but didn't love it. 

My first complaint is that there is no free parking near the restaurant. I had to pay to park or walk a mile. 
I arrived on a slow Monday, so when I walked in there were tons of spaces available. Unfortunately the hostess/cashier was busy, so despite there being ten employees behind the counter, I just stood there twiddling my thumbs waiting on someone to notice I was hungry and seat me. Finally when the hostess finished, I had to ASK ""can I be seated?"" Seating is all at the bar--no tables. So probably not a place you'd bring a big group or small kids. 
The waiter was quick and friendly once I sat and my food arrived almost before I ordered it. The grits were pretty good--very buttery and just the right consistency. I thought I was going to vomit though when I took my first bite of my ham omelette--it tasted like fryer fat! But I think that the end of it must have been at the edge of the grill or something, because subsequent bites were less offensive. 
The hash browns were decent, although I ended up adding some Crystal hot sauce to everything to give it all a kick. 
So the food was good. Not amazing, but good. 
Then I went to check out and despite me handing my check and credit card to the hostess first, she aided a man who came in to fill out an application before she ran my card through. I gave her the evil eye and left feeling like overall, the Cameilla Grill probably wasn't worth the effort next time."
93,puiZTz1kUn2NfD4YRF2t6w,"Every New Orleanian must go to Camellia Grill.  So we did.  It was my 1st time.  Won't be back unless I am with a group that insists we go.  Got an omelet.  It was nothing special and over-priced.  So, been there, done that."
94,VPy6_2-RAmx5tjgcZB_w5Q,"I know it's a new orleans gem because it's been around for a while but it's really your average, if not below average, diner food. The staff on the other hand is wonderful and the atmosphere is as well. Wish you could rate the staff and the food separately. Been here 4 times now."
95,JXCXfhVfwENVERZNKKgGTg,Always a must visit in NOLA!   It's a wait but worth it and generally fun in line with others.  Muffaletta is great and enough for two to leave room for warm pecan pie with ice cream!  Diner style....all counter service...no tables. Staff have been there years and love to interact with diners. Just notified this visit that they have added a location in the French Quarter!
96,ybfrGCtzECyF_ZOsC_xnFQ,"As a tourist, this was a fun to-do off the St. Charles streetcar line on a lazy day.  The food was mediocre but satisfying.  The ambiance was the real experience and we waited 40 minutes in line outside for the opportunity.  It was a one-time stop for us as the food would not bring us back, even at the very cheap prices.  

The restaurant is a long snaking counter top with counter service.   They counters were dirty and wet. Everyone seemed to be in a rush although friendly so we were never offered refills or extra napkins after we used ours to wipe the counter down.  Like I said,  one-time-experience as it was unusual."
97,0vcYT7x2CCH-5Cnb7n0hUw,Can never go wrong at Camellia Grill. I always get an omelet and they really do have the best coffee!
98,H-DeCSkoKHi2WpxMqBfBUg,"This place is small, get there early or plan to wait.  It is certainly worth the wait.  Grits and pecan pie were to die for.  You sit at a counter rubbing elbows with fellow patrons.  If you want a quiet place to eat this isn't for you.  But if you want a good southern breakfast served with charm and humor - you'll love Camellia Grill."
99,_A3syqxzonojPbw_1Mv3qw,"We made it in on a Sunday morning just before the line started forming. One of the few bonuses of having children who wake up early. Atmosphere is fast and friendly. We were greeted and severed our beverages quickly, and the food all came up in 10 min (maybe less?). 
The kids had pancakes with a side of perfectly cooked bacon. They devoured them, and they devour very few things. Happy parents!
The adults each had omelets (mine veggie, his, something with ham). Totally satisfying. We've finally found that classic breakfast spot in the city. No fuss, just great breakfast food with quick, friendly service, a fun atmosphere, and a serious VALUE. We will be back!"
100,4aJY-Q8qE4JJxTcD0uwCrA,"Oh.my.god. This is the heart stoppin southern food I've always dreamed about! If you're in the Nawlins area this place is a must.  Take the street car down through the Garden District- that trip alone will be an experience! It's a bit of wait- but well worth it. The meal itself is one you won't forget. You get a front row ticket to the show. These guys are off the hook! I guarantee these guys can turn your frown upside down. I love um.  Marvin is my absolute favorite. He can have his own show. I had a chicken sandwich caked in mayo. It was JUICY and delicious. As if that wasn't enough of a heart attack, I topped it off with some chili cheese fries.  My favorite part of the meal was when I saw the GALLON of butter being poured on the grill. I knew I was in the right spot.  As Marvin says, ""if its really good you go, mmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmhhhhh and if its REALLY, REALLY good you go mmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmh with your eyes closed. I give this place an eye close : )"
101,C7XX-It7fWVRRUjHvwtDog,"This place isn't for you if you want to complain about the messy kitchen. It's all part of the experience, baby.

The fellas behind the counter have it going on. Never once have I eaten here and not wanted to return just to dap fists again with my server. Watching the crew work together in unison is awesome, and makes me love and appreciate the tasty goodness they put in front of me even more.

Faves:
Chocolate Freeze (ALWAYS)
Bacon Cheeseburger, dressed 
Harry's Yankee (roast beef, melted swiss, grilled onions, on special roll with cole slaw & mushroom sauce...YOU'RE WELCOME!!!)
Chocolate Pecan Pie a la mode (ALWAYS)

Think Twice:
Cheese Fries-Your cheese never quites melt right. Go standard fries or ask for gravy 
Cheesecake-It's a basic bitch compared to the queen diva chocolate pecan pie.

Kids' Faves:
French Fry Po-Boy (Carb Lover's Delite)
Chicken Strips (seriously, they are pretty tasty)

Tip well and use your manners, don't linger too long after you finish! It's a small space, so help your fellow Yelper eat by clearing out."
102,R4D6VSyXxyCU31Pj9geCKQ,"I would go here just for the chocolate pecan pie! Served warm (they toss it on the grill with some butter) with ice cream....I'm salivating just thinking about it. 

Camellia Grill is one of those places we HAVE to go to every visit. My husband always orders the Chef's Special omelet, you never know what you'll find in it! It's huge, the sixe of a rolled newspaper. The burgers are fantastic too. 

There is usually a line out the door, there are only a few seats inside, but its worth the wait! The waiters are always friendly and make you feel like you are a regular there. So glad they re-opened after Katrina!"
103,9I682tgYJonYnB7gYmFhJA,"Best meal I've had here in NOLA. The service was flawless. I've never had such a kind waiter who really knows how to do his job. As soon as you sit down you feel at home in the quaint little diner. The kitchen is right there, so there are no secrets as to what's happening 'behind the curtain'. Everything is clean and maintained. I ordered Harry's Yankee Po'Boy and my boyfriend got a bacon cheeseburger. His burger was pretty big and loaded with fresh juicy bacon. He gobbled it down fairly fast while I enjoyed my Po'Boy loaded with roast beef, grilled onions, Swiss, and a delicious brown gravy. At 10"" long this Po'Boy was absolutely filling but oh so delicious. We both got fries, which were crispy and soft. The freezes seemed popular so we ordered a mocha freeze and a chocolate cream pie. They were both amazing! The best part? It didn't break the bank! We will definitely be back!!"
104,r-fj_X0nm4LF_weQxZzFaA,driving by one evening and saw a sign in front .25 cent oysters on the half shell. quickly turned around and consumed two dozen with a cold draft. what a deal. 6 bucks for dinner. This special is every tuesday night
105,hl6vT6L-gXcThBStVg2yyQ,"Food is amazing, service is amazing! Truly enjoyed ourselves this is a much more cozy Waffle House, New Orleans original Camelias, this is a gem down on Carrollton!! I will be back, omelette fluffy cooked to perfection, the red beans were wickedly delicious."
106,4h2_xViYqN2STZkL5v6voA,Great place for breakfast or early lunch. Hilarious great service! If you are there you definitely want to sit in Charlie's section. He'll take care of you!
107,ODDITKtT_G4yThmIATaB9w,"Was there with sis in Feb....food was solid and I enjoyed the diner atmosphere.  Service was friendly and attentive, especially for a diner.  We went late in the morning so no wait.   I ordered an omelet...and when I order any egg dish, I usually don't have high expectations....but it was really good - soft, fluffy and most importantly not dry and overcooked!  Hallelujah!"
108,uutZFDVG9gzU7z3RF4lkww,"Great meal at reasonable prices. The burgers are great and the hash browns are even better.  Everything is cooked to order in front of you. There is an entertaining banter between wait staff and the ""chefs"".  I always enjoy stopping here for a late night meal wether it be breakfast for dinner or a burger.  I did notice that the hours have changed so not sure if there is a new owner or not.  Still have a line out the door at random hours.  May not be your typical New Orleans food but definitely a local favorite but locals like a good diner like the rest of the world."
109,9y9U0MTMwldN_7fgAb0NjA,"Where to start? Hmmmmm I don't eat pancakes besides my own but baby let me tell you, those pancakes are nice and fluffy! Delicious. The mushroom omelet is huge. Nothing is frozen or fake tasting. I love it!! The staff is friendly and helpful. They seem to love and care about their customers. Excellent customer service. I must say, it's a place you can not pass up!"
110,uSBh6wY6mnMe-iquSFsPqg,"Camellia Grill is a top choice for late night food establishments. It is the best restaurant to eat at in New Orleans after 11PM. I usually get the club sandwich as it comes with French fries. Sometimes I get the gumbo along with it. An alternate entrée I get often is the fried catfish plate with cole slaw and French fries. Camellia Grill has breakfast food like omelets, and it's suppose to be excellent according to people who eat it. I don't like breakfast food so I never get it."
111,Evbys-HiYd_EEjmaP_Taog,"Apparently, there is a regular crew working tirelessly for years, and it became clear when regulars came in and exchanged friendly greetings with them. 

The five of us were lucky to be seated immediately next to each other and were greeted with fist bumps from Martin. He took our orders without writing anything down and as a result, I didn't get sausage; I got bacon. My colleague didn't get bacon at all and our neighbors were missing something as well. 

My order of bacon, eggs, and hash brown were good but nothing special. I've heard you want to order the pecan waffle or pecan pancakes as those are something, but I had a bite of a pecan waffle. Eh. 

I like the small-ness of the place and its unusual shaped counter. It felt like stepping back in time in the south with its great big white pillars and charming interior. 

There was a bottle placed in front of us which I didn't recognize, so I asked my former colleague who now lives there what it was, and she said it was butter. As I looked at other patrons pouring the stuff out, I saw no trepidation. Apparently, this is normal and genius. It makes putting butter and syrup that much easier. 

Surprisingly, they took credit cards, and I added tip to my order. For $9.00 with tip, I got my usual breakfast and didn't leave super full but did leave satisfied. 

They also serve something called freezes which are apparently milkshakes, and their omelettes are also popular and large, as I witnessed first hand when neighbors ordered them. Those might be a better fulfilling deal. 

I also saw someone order red beans and rice, so I think they serve all kinds of food all day."
112,TpeoAjLSc7xm9GXYvx5PrQ,Great spot for burgers and good old fashion greasy breakfast.  The atmosphere is great with really funny and personable staff.  Great banter between the staff and customers.  I had a burger and order of chili cheese fries and the tab was under 10 which was a great deal for the amount of food I had.   The breakfast items also look great.  Will definately hit this place up from breakfast before I leave town in a couple days.
113,yQ2XawvLZVR26gb2GJ1MDg,"The Camellia Grill is another venerable New Orleans dining institution that is well worth checking out. After Hurricane Katrina, the previous owners did not re-open, and the many Camellia fans covered the doors with sticky notes professing their affections for the place and their hopes of being able to return to dine there. Fortunately, new owners bought the place and brought it back.

True, it is a greasy spoon diner that is good for late night diners but it's also a place that people from all walks of life go to, from tourists, nearby Loyola and Tulane students, NOLA residents, cops, and has the occasional James Carville sighting (I happened to be reading his latest book from the public library when he was there).

Whether it's one of their great omelets, burgers, or freezes, it's a welcome change from the rich foods of New Orleans restaurants (especially those places that serve too-small portions that leave you still hungry after dining). It's worth a wait for the food, counter seats, and the friendly, fist-bumping servers. It's an added bonus that you can take the St. Charles streetcar line for a scenic ride from the Quarter, through the CBD and Garden District all the way down there."
114,tKYSkzuWAb27TMCT8_Q92A,"What can be said about this place that has not already been said?  It's a quaint storefront with well made comfort cafe food.  I always have the eggs & hash browns and I split a pecan waffle with the husband. Filling home style food to set you up for a great day exploring the garden district.  The friendly staff are just and extra, the cherry on top, and those gorgeous marble counter tops are the whipped cream!"
115,PTA04mH-3Z_jZejbGREZjg,Not my first choice when visiting new orleans. Kinda dirty and very busy. Reminds me of waffle house
116,fmyquTmEhBmGNrKRwk4jGA,Aweosme experience. Food was awesome and big portions. The waiters and cooks are fun and very nice and the pricing is really reasonable! Perfect combination for a perfect brunch to end a fun vacation in NOLA!
117,afJffJfAv1h9jCi3BxF-ow,Great little cozy diner experience.  The food is delicious and the wait staff is very friendly!
118,TMrBX86kYxlocuSefimQAA,"The food is delicious! I highly recommend the Camellia Grill for breakfast, the omelet was amazing! We had exceptional service. Our server, Joe was excellent! Very kind and always had a smile on his face! I will be returning on my next trip to New Orleans."
119,zB-b6glrVk_HsHRgkgPpRg,Super entertaining breakfast with our hosts. All the breakfast basics that taste better than any place else. The pancakes are the best i have ever had.
120,GXg6WuAy_tHDViOEUzfThQ,One resurant in New Orleans I will never forget.  We were welcomed with open arms and our stomachs were happily fed. Camellia Grill has been around since 1946 and after being there you'll understand why.  We had the Chocolate Freeze and Bacon Cheesburger and they both were one of the highlights of our trip. Michael was our waitor...he made us feel right at home. He was very genuine and sincere to us our entire time there.  Will absolutely be back !...Word!
121,lDKE5nTpCpuKvdzid43lhA,"Just normal breakfast food, but normal breakfast food done REALLY RIGHT. I doubt I'll be going to breakfast anywhere else. There is always a line which sucks in this Nola heat, but as everyone else has said, it's well worth it. 

ALSO, IT IS OPEN LATE HOURS."
122,9WxAEzDYnLZQgJc3xivi1A,"Came here for the first time for lunch. I liked the old style lunch counter seating. Brun my counter server was relaxed, friendly and efficient. I had the fried chicken strips but sorry to say they did not taste like the were made on the premises. Tasted like frozen chicken strips that they fried and were on the dry side. I got the corn mach choux (spelling?) Which is a southern treat I can`t get at home. Large portions. I`d probably go back to try breakfast."
123,qhCPWfnT84zXnWmb4Eg2gQ,I hear a lot of hype about this place so I had to try it for myself. I must say that it wasn't all what I expected at all.  The menu is pretty bland and the food wasn't great.
124,-_XGeqP2vFWo-B8ZQ6GXbg,"Are you kidding,it's an instant pleasure to my senses,it's a landmark.Love everything & appreciate the laginappe by the great staff,always entertaining!!"
125,pri2Wx9JK2SftVbXX4ybZA,"We LOVE this place.  Best breakfast in town (and in the South for that matter).  I'd take the family here every Sunday morning if I lived in the Big Easy.   

We actually visited here back in 2004 and, thankfully, it hasn't changed a bit in the past 9 years. 

Situated at the corner of S. Carrolton and St. Charles, this New Orleans institution is located in a beautiful area of town known as The Garden District.  

It's a traditional diner with counter seating only.  

The service is great!  The waiters are funny and entertaining.  

Coffee is tasty and it is STRONG.  

The menu has pretty much anything you want for breakfast.  If you want a heart-healthy breakfast, this is NOT the place for you. It's down-home greasy tasty breakfast. You will leave here fat and happy.  

I love the Omelets.  Pretty much any omelet you get is good. The pancakes and egg sandwiches are also quite delicious.  

To top it off, prices are very reasonable. 

Come early or be prepared to wait."
126,ErIdqgbe_TVQuqCWuQQ3BQ,"This place is pretty straight forward. Breakfast and lunch dinner with animated old school wait staff. We usually come on a Saturday after soccer, if the line isn't around the building. Not sure what all the fuss is about, as Camellia Grill isn't the best breakfast stop, but it's decent. The biggest drawback for me is the seating. It's very crowded, and you will definitely be grazing knees or elbows with whomever is sitting next to you. It's fine for a quick bite with a person or two, but not a good place for groups."
127,i1n6qNBHLbwoEsPUl2GVXQ,"Camellia Grill, you're like an old friend to me. From the BLTs I used to eat in high school to the chili cheese fries I split with my now-husband when he first visited NOLA and met my parents years ago to the orange freeze I had there last week, you've been there throughout my life. One can say that my life is punctuated with pecan waffles and Judge's Chicken sandwiches. Just keep doing what you do, Camellia Grill, because I (and New Orleans) love you and are so glad to have you in our lives!"
128,sR9nWNl-7jMZkzjnwk6qbA,"I'd give this place 5 stars for uniqueness and personality of our waiter. This is type of place you want to take out of town friends bc it makes you feel like you've rolled back in time to a 50s diner with friendly smiling folks. It's almost like a theme park restaurant where the waiter is happy and cheery that be greets you with GOOD MORNING! And whips out quick little jokes to make you feel at home and confortable. The food was not the best. They also do not serve booze. It's basically juices, water, milks, coffee. That's not really a big deal but it may deter others looking for a hang over bloody mary. I had eggs over easy which were a lil over cooked, bacon which was thin flat bacon, toast and hash browns, which were greasy but not amazing. I tens to love me some greasy buttery stuff and this food is def that but just didn't have enough to draw my taste buds in. I do understand taste experience would have been different had I ordered an omlet. They do say they have one of the best. Over all I was happy with this place. It was fun. I would take out of town friends here for sure."
129,davaIwNfOKjpYpjey_-Qxw,"I LOVE breakfast food, and I like entertainment. This was the first place I went to eat when I visited New Orleans last year.  He was bragging about how good the food was and if anyone knows me they know it's a pain for me to agree with anyone. So I went in ready to prove him wrong and I found myself agreeing. The food was great, affordable, and the portions were large!

To make things even better there is banter going on between the cooks and the customers that was absolutely hilarious, spontaneous and completely entertainment.  It's definitely a place I want to visit again."
130,-ngvzzeT8q2x_ScKB7hzGA,"I ate at Camellia Grill (French Quarter location) for the first time this morning and may I say it was a great experience. The place is crowded, bustling, and full of New Orleans personality! The minute we walked in my mouth began watering. I'm pretty sure they hire people to stand in line and make the wait longer so you see all the different food orders on the table! All jokes aside, the atmosphere is pure energy with the waiters yelling multiple orders at the chef (yes, chef) and the line cooks teasing the newer employees and the food is melt in your mouth delicious. We had the chef omelette which is ham, turkey, bacon, onions, and potatoes mixed with egg smothered in chili, hashbrowns, a side of sausage and bacon, with a chocolate milk. This is a truly classy joint that takes pride in their work. The juice is worth the squeeze so to speak."
131,nEy4c8VN79t1J_8LnVLsOA,"So, after reading the reviews, you already know that the food here is great.  I'm not going to waste any time recounting the delicious burger, the tasty coffee milkshake, or the cheese fries.  What I am going to describe is the experience of watching my friend attempt to eat her chili omelette.

The omelette probably weighed 3 pounds - no joke.  It smelled delicious and was covered in hot, bubbling chili.  Towards the last 1/4 of the omelette, my friend started to slow down... and turn green.  But all hope was not lost!  Our waiter, whose name I forgot, taunted her into submission.  Screaming to the rest of the diners, he exclaimed to all that she was weak for not being able to finish her meal, that she needed to ""slam it down"" and ""finish it now.""  Amazing.  Then, when her face turned as red as the chili on her plate, he told her that she was a ""delightful shade of red.""

In all of my years dining on this planet, I have never witnessed anything so funny/embarrassing.  Even if you're not hungry, go for the intimate, friendly, and deliciously funny staff."
132,-bJ7-rAf2vF_MPcqH1uryA,"This is the second time I went there for breakfast. The breakfast food is ok, good atmosphere, but there are flies all over. Won't go back."
133,dnvEFG-70fntAPspfXpgWA,"We hardly had to wait at all. We went on a Sunday morning around nine and only stood outside for a minute or two. Next in the waiting process is to go in and to the big green bench/couch on the left. I think we were on that for ten to fifteen minutes. 

How is the place? Go look at the pictures. That's it. Study them and you can see what the setup is like. There are no tables,  you face the cooks and will sit next to a stranger [or two people in your party will.]

I had 3 pecan pancakes, an egg over medium [to see if they did them right,] and shared an order of bacon, six slices, with my daughter. She got a over medium and hashbrowns. Wife got normal pancakes. Good, but I suggest upping it to the pecan ones.

My pancakes were not as pretty as my wifes, but they were very good. This isn't IHOP for the sheeple masses here. This is good food. Bacon was bacon, and that's always good. Hashbrowns were good, nothing amazing, but we didn't really want some bizarre epicurian hashbrowns.

Now, that egg. It wasn't over medium. It was closer to over easy. Now, that's fine as I had hashbrowns I could steal, and did, from my daughter to take care of the extra yolk, but I did order over medium and they missed.

This is more a ""let me show you something"" place to take friends. I'm sure there is a mom and pop hole-in-the-wall that does it just as good. And as beautiful as the street it's on is, there is no outside seating. Though if you go during peak hours, you'll get to wait out there for a long time."
134,XjeDKH1wflLtpI60cZL0HQ,"You've got to try this place if you find yourself near Loyola or Tulane. The double U shaped counter offers a unique dining experience. We dropped by for breakfast and waited about 10 minutes for a spot together at the bar. (They do a great job of keeping parties together.) It's definitely diner food - but it is stick-to-your-ribs good. Our waiter, Leon, was amazing to watch. He flawlessly called out an order for five people to the man at the grill and then checked back a few minutes later with the grillman to make sure he was getting it right! 

We had the pancakes with turkey bacon and with regular pork bacon. The pancakes were surprisingly light and fluffy and my bacon was fatty - just like I requested. We were in and out of there quickly. They didn't rush us but we weren't about to linger with a crowd of about 30 people eyeing our spot!

Tip: If you are visiting and staying near the French Quarter or the business district and want to try this original location, take the green line St. Charles street car to the S. Carrollton stop. It's a great ride and you get to see some of the garden district, the front of Tulane and Loyola campuses and Audubon Park."
135,DRvyPlrI-DWvll7cPe09ug,"A Local's Favorite Haunt

This place was amazing.  You have to imagine being transported back in time to a 1940s-1950s style Diner where all of the seats are at the Gill Counter!  A place were the food is fantastic, the portions are humongus, the service is top shelf, and the prices are realllllly good.

Everyone in our group walked out of there holding our stomachs and echoing the Alca-Seltzer commercial from the 1970's --""I can't believe, I ate the whole thing!!!!""
This is THE place to have breakfast/Lunch, or plan for a LARGE Take-out order of fabulous food.  Only get there early if you are planning on having a breakfast on the weekend. 

We got there around 9:40 AM on a Saturday.  Waited about 5 minutes and were seated.  When we left around 10:40, in addition to the 20 or so sitting on seats inside, the line was out the door and at least 20 deep!

It is located in Carrolton/Uptown, near the river bend on the St Charles Streetcar line.  So unless you are a local, or know about it, or are willing know the Streetcar routes, you might never hear of it.  But it is accessible for locals as well as out of towners who know where it is & how to get there using public or private transportation.

Wonderful & Fabulous are the words that best describe The ""Omelettes"".  One in our group was trying to cut down on too many calories for breakfast, while at the same time actively seeking to enjoy.  She opted for the ""Rano's"" which contains: Egg White, Baby Spinach, Onion, & Swiss Cheese.  Consider this a sort of Weight Watcher's or dieter conscience safety valve.  That is until you add the included side of either Fries, or Hashbrowns, or the Absolutely Outstanding Grits (which is only served 8-11AM).  Without any question, those were some of the sweetest/butteriest/melt in your mouth grits that my wife and I have ever tasted.

Pecan Waffle and egg, was the preferred choice of our friend who brought us there, which he loved.

After studying the menu, I opted for the ""Chef's Special Omelette"" (Turkey, bacon, Ham, Potato, Onions, American and Swiss Chesse --- TOPPED with some of the tastiest chili I can remember-- Also, I could not resist having the obligatory choice of those fabulous Grits).  

Our eyes bugged out as everyone's order filled the entire extra large oblong platter plate.  

There is an extensive menu as well for ""Hamburgers, Dinner Plates, Whole Meal Sandwiches, 10"" Po-Boys, Hot Sandwiches, Cold Sandwiches, Soups & Salads, Freezes, and Desserts"".  Their descriptive names of the various offerings (i.e. Lilly's Chicken Strips, Mardi Gras Sandwich, Doc Brinkers Special, or Judge's Chicken), are right out of the Diner Kitchen Shorthand lingo 

Unfortunately, we did not have any room, nor time left in NO to return and try some of it.  Sooooooo, we will just have to return there next time, FOR SURE!!!!"
136,mf40ktcBq9wHEWzd1gpbiw,Great place great service great food but you should always expect a wait. Don't go here if you have a large group or are looking to take your time eating. It's a very rushed atmosphere due to limited seating.
137,VAJLzgvW69EfWbPlWGpJkg,"Are you kidding me? . . We only had pie,  but it was the best ever. . Served fast and fun on their old school counter. . Definitely stop in when your on the St Charles trolley line. . Lots of fun."
138,LlPjcTBEpDRC9J9RdTHHMw,"literally just a breakfast joint. seriously, nothing special. 
I got the waffles (good flavor but thin) and a sausage link (which came at the END of my meal when I was already finished with the waffle.)"
139,9NURXVKxBKM34S_6wYHPSw,"I wanted to like this place, I really did. The one star is for the very nice cooks that work there. Other than that, I don't even know where to begin...

Let me start by saying that there is no organized way of seating people at this place. Which would have been nice when an older gentleman... A much older gentleman... Sat next to us on the waiting bench smelling like he had... ehem... In his pants, which was only confirmed by what was left on the seat when he stood up. I understand you can't control what your customers do, but someone in my party had to tell them to clean it up. Not to mention, no one cleaned the seat he dined on once he finished eating before someone else sat there. We sat smelling that for 20 more minutes and finally got seated once we took it upon ourselves to find a seat. Everything was smooth sailing from there: service was friendly, food was good.

Unfortunately, those in my party had a touch of food poisoning that night. I was not as lucky and almost ended up in the hospital from being sick.

Like I said, I wanted to like this place. But just hearing the name makes my stomach turn, and I won't be back."
140,DeHGEwnTUmrwWXdBZF0LOA,"Had a fab waiter, Chris, who was super-entertaining and friendly. The food was simple, but good. Great, old fashioned atmosphere."
141,7MipPzZRHLvby9jam39jbA,"Dirty diner food. Guys serving you sweating all over the place. Never saw anyone wash their hands. Food is actually tasty, which I suppose is the only redeeming quality."
142,eAdzP9qmrmXIUTbOfVDIMQ,This place has everything you want in a diner. Nothing fancy. Just excellent food and a great vibe.
143,GKH4BqrvzEpmrfzBYuzFIQ,"An iconic location in the Big Easy. Usually a late nite stop after you are done with the Rock and Bowl! For me this was ""breakfast"" after a short burst of physical activity along Saint Charles Ave.... Yep, that was me runnin', stumblin', bummblin' for a cup of really great joe followed by Rano's Omelette (egg whites, baby spinach, & onions) with side of grits. The egg whites give the omelette a fluffy, almost moist texture, add the wilted spinach and diced onions that makes the texture turn slightly to the left with bits of soft crunch and a slurp of spinach. Add the grits to even the flavor (dash of salt and pepper to season) and breakfast!"
144,Gdivci5uAqAz7_sNY-5U1g,"The service was super great, these guys deserve a great tip. I ordered the Mexican omelette (I think that's what it was) and it was huge! It had lots of flavor to it. My friend ordered a burger and so perhaps next time I'll be back for that. YOU MUST TRY THE MAC-N-CHEESE PATTY. I don't remember the exact name, but just think the crunchiness of tator-tots but filled with macaroni and cheese! What a genius invention. The reasons why I'm not giving this 5 stars is because the bacon was overcooked and it caused a me stomach ache, and when I ordered waffles and chicken to-go, it was a flimsy ""waffle"" without any flavor and the chicken was a super small, grilled chicken breasted that you could finish in two bites. I was disappointed because I had just enjoyed this great meal then the to-go meal was a big bummer."
145,q0NaFDAGyq_A9K18FAN-Ww,"Awesome. For tourists and locals alike, this place is one of the best to grab a simple, delicious meal. I love the omelettes, which probably give you the best bang for your buck. Maybe my favorite thing about this place is that, on weekend nights, they're open until 2 a.m. This is the perfect stop after a night out."
146,H9Nc00UfWr7r9Os6eoFE1w,"I did not find this in any tour book.  I still suggest that for breakfast,ask a native,or a resident.  Though we were recommended to the uptown location,right now it is 100 degrees in New Orleans,and this location was five blocks away,on Chartres in the French Quarter.
What you get is real food,served by enthusiastic waiters and you sit communally at a  counter...and the fun begins...great food,I had some special with turkey,ham,bacon in an omlette with...chili on top...I cannot recommend this place enough...but if you are looking for quiet(aka...hungover) this is not the place to go."
147,6lm4174XiBQKV9apQTdelQ,"The consummate greasy spoon, the institution that is The Camellia Grill is one not to miss when out in NOLA. Located in the East Carrolton right next to the Mississippi, it is a fun place to go any time of the day. However, being the consummate late night owl that I am, I prefer to hit it up when I'm too boozed and too hungry.

It is the kind of diner anyone would love. A great mix of personalities on the patron side (think families during the day, drunk college kids at night) and some of the friendliest staff you'll ever meet. It's casual and with its counter situation (facing the kitchen), one has no choice but interact, be it a neighbor or staff taking an order.

The prices have probably creeped up over the years, but since their rebirth a la Katrina after several years, I am sure they could use all the extra pennies they can get. And having tasted their food, I'm happy to fork it over.

A healthy spot it is not. Southern breakfast staples like waffles / French toast, milkshakes, and even root beer floats are in constant rotation here. I personally am a huge fan of their burgers here, which are small but packed with lots of greasy flavor. Hash browns, my all time favorite starchy breakfast potato, is unfortunately a little disappointing as it was bland and soaked in oil. Knowing how most southern joints can crank out a quality hash brown, I haven't lost hope in Camellia yet.

The next time I find myself out till the wee hours of the evening and with some type of vehicle to take me to the east side of town, it's virtually a guarantee I'll be back at Camellia Grill to get my eat on. Beware of the lines as this place is crazy popular and embrace the historical significance that has served the community for many decades (and hopefully many more!)."
148,VGim8LMiIhYmt4rnlfFXQQ,What a fun place to eat. You take the St Charles trolley to almost the end of the line. It can take about 45 minutes. There is a line to get in to this very small counter-style restaurant but it moves very fast. Here you will fine great breakfast meals and lunch and dinner. You are served by cheerful counter waiters in pink baseball caps. They wisecrack and joke with you so much you will feel right at home. I had the Yankee po-boy and it was huge big enough for two people. The pecan waffles are simple and delicious.
149,l2BmqY_K1cpikwryJncIhA,"Wait was so long. Food is OK. We were not served water until much later, had to ask for a refill. We also didn't get our coffees or orange juice until after we were served our meal. Then the BLTs arrived the bacon was cold. The rest of the people in our party had to ask for their side orders of bacon and sausage. It seemed they just forgot. Everyone was nice but we wished it had been a better experience for the amount of time we waited."
150,IpS_jEl5ZM3u1Bwqtpu1vA,"I have been going to Camellia Grill for twenty years, and this old time diner has not changed at all. It was probably there before I was born roughly twenty years before that. I am glad they have not changed because it is a solid gold diner of the highest caliber. Breakfast or brunch, whether before a big day or after a long night. Their famous chilli omelet, their kick-ass burgers and fries, their damn-that's-good shakes, their fountain drinks, and club sandwiches. 

Wearing old school uniforms even in the hottest month of a New Orleans summer, the staff takes pride in the quality of your breakfast, their service and their own personal connection with you as another human being. Tulane students, the eccentric bourgeois who reside in this neighborhood, and a few streetcar stranglers visiting from out of town--all commune here perched on stools behind the zig-zag counter.  The atmosphere is intimate, and this being New Orleans, you'll probably get to chatting, and might just make friends. Thankfully though this place is too far from the quarter to have been ruined by tourism although it might not be long. There is a CG in the quarter. Tourists, kindly stay there, alright?

Go late in the evening or very early in the morning to avoid the crowd although there might be a few partiers ahead of you in line. If you are lucky, you will be one of them.  Maybe you are just a voyeur and get your kicks watching and whispering. If so, you're likely to  have plenty of antics to gawk at here, a nice little show while you eat your pancakes. At the very least, you'll have yourself an outstanding breakfast and leave feeling very happy. It might be from the twenty cups of coffee you just ingested, granted. If a greasy-spoon world champion were awarded, it might very well be given to Camilla Grill."
151,tkE8R0fH8lgVgbXFcZ2V6g,This is an awesome breakfast place. Food is always good! The staff is always friendly & helpful!
152,CcWN9Il53topJHJnuZNnJw,"This is a solid choice if you are looking for a greasy spoon type of place. If you are not looking for a greasy spoon type of place, the grass IS greener elsewhere (i.e. avoid the salad). The staff was fun once they warmed up a bit. This prices are very affordable."
153,VsCjY0_HD9Ox_ysQBco3mQ,"Went to Camellia Grill for the first time in many years last night. I was hoping for a trip down memory lane since it was a go-to spot during college and many years after. However, it was not meant to be. I found the place grungy, wait staff/cashier had no personality what-so-ever. I wanted the buzz and laughter that always came with going to the Grill. The food was mediocre at best. I ordered a BLT with crispy bacon, and got barely toasted bread with rubbery bacon. I ordered a cup of coffee which never came. With all the places in the city to eat, I'll not return nor will I recommend it. So sad."
154,lvIF8EePoCNafdYd0qLUOQ,"Had a fantastic, affordable diner meal at a convenient 1 am!! Enjoyed the atmosphere and had great fun with Dennis! Highly recommended for a good, easy stop!"
155,-d3RM_wGPNbE7laDLEPGmg,"I was hesitant to eat here, given that it was recommended by a college student who eats anything!  Well, surprise!  It was really good!  I had a bacon burger, cooked to perfection!  The fries are good, too, as is the banana cream pie!  Such a great place!  And, the staff is awesome--they really make the place friendly and welcoming.  Frog was our waiter:  what a doll!

There will probably be a wait, and you can only sit at the counter, fyi."
156,gmU3LT2IAq2V_QD3U8PjeQ,Loved it!  Awesome greasy spoon!  Gumbo was delicious!  Take the St Charles trolley.  Got full them ready for a walk around the nearby Audubon Park
157,F6T79Ny9ObeOnToqS84CXA,"We were disappointed. We have been coming here for 36 years and the service and food have slipped in quality. My wife's toast never arrived. My dinner plate didn't arrive until our companions were almost through with their meals. And when it did, the meat was barely warm.  My son had to ask twice for his Coke.  We arrived at a time when there were plenty of seats so I can't blame it on an overworked staff.  Everyone was cordial and friendly but the attention to details wasn't there. With so many great new places on Freret these days, we'll go there instead."
158,bsBoq1z-xcvtUXQL3Ge2yw,"The best thing about the camellia grill is definitely the atmosphere. It feels just like an old-timey diner with long white counter seating. We came in just for dessert and we're immediately treated like regulars. The man behind the counter was very friendly and gave us some great suggestions. It felt like a place with a lot of history! We got the apple pie, banana cream pie, and chocolate pecan pie (definite stand out!) They we're all delicious. I would love to come back and have a proper meal there, the omelettes sounded amazing!"

When you go, make sure to watch the waiters as they give you your straw...my kids love it."
161,rWJw1rCUGIoa5EDdYwO89g,"Really great diner for breakfast. It's only counter seating, which is cool. We tried the breakfast po boys and they hit the spot.  Also try the chili cheese fries and the iced coffee. Really fast service!

162,KfNvOanVF3-kKO60aYKHlA,"When I visit the Crescent City, this is a staple for me.

A friend of mine who is a student at Loyola brought me here and transformed my understanding of a great diner. The characters who serve you are just as amazing as the food you get. 

The counter tables allow you to meet new people, which is pretty awesome as the cosmopolitan/tourist nature of New Orleans brings many people. Our friends to my left were Dutch, and to my right we had some people from Wisconsin with awesome accents and across the counter were some gothic rockers, and next to them were a family of Koreans. Confirmation that I am in an awesome place.

My double burger was delicious and juicy, and fries were typical, but that was alright with me. Get the pecan pie, but if you get it warmed (Veggie alert!) know that they put it on the same surface they cook burgers... And good thing I'm not a vegetarian because that's fine with me!

Say hi to Marvin for me!"
163,cd_Ee2b-Oc8NVEpn4RVvAQ,"The Camellia Grill at 540 Chartres Street in New Orleans' French Quarter is the only place I got kicked out of during my explorations of the Crescent City.

And that was for walking in with a drink.

'Chef' yelled at me 'NO ALCOHOL IN HERE' and he gestured with his spatula in a menacing way.

I don't mess with chefs.

Especially anywhere near the kitchen.

They're usually hot... they got lots of sharp pokey things to stick you with and I've had this recurring dream where one of them plants my face on the grill.

I don't like that dream.

So when 'Chef' kicked me out I didn't protest or even negotiate...

I figured I'd just go back out on the street and finish my N'awlins Slurpee outside and then come in for a little late night snackin' action.

Before I hit the exit 'Chef' and the rest of the crew at the Camilla Grill let me know that they were joking and that I could stay.

Which was cool...

because 'Chef' grilled me up one helluva Rueben and I was really cravin' that action.

I stopped in again and I took a picture of 'Chef' when we were talkin' about it...

and he cooked me up a killer Muffaletta.

Oh man this place is some good food.

The guys at the counter will keep you entertained and 'Chef' will cook you up some good grub fast.

They did remind me that next time I decided to walk in with a drink that'd be polite and courteous to bring one for everyone.

Thanks for the great late night snackin' action 'Chef' Will.

You da bomb!"
164,2qq6R_kAW50fyCL867pjAA,The burger was awesome! The fries were crispy and good! The chocolate freeze were awesome and true to its name!
165,TYGs49Jz-btOcacNOvUrlw,Great local place!!  Only in New Orleans do you get syrup dispenser and a butter dispenser!  Staff is a blast!!
166,FIhgVCK0aAZ8JepMNycIiQ,"Camellia Grill - open late, prices cheap, and ok food. Somehow, people fall ass over tea kettle for how great this places is, and I will never know why. I have never had a bad experience, but neither have I had an experience that would make me wait the the line that can form around the block to get in on some mornings. Now, maybe late at night, when I am totally plastered, I may wait in line - which, in fairness, I have done."
167,QCcebuF8S_5tVlbRfr6b_A,Went there for lunch. The staff likes to entertain. Food is below average. Restrooms are in back. Went and saw the backroom. Had I went before eating would have left. Nor clean
168,rUwOy95nJKjQQYgHZaFCsw,Waited in line about 40 min on a Sunday morning but it was definitely worth the wait. I dont know what they put in the pancakes but they are absolutely amazing! The burgers are delicious too!
169,-j-amLnROQPq0EGbsF2r6w,"This counter-only diner was good and the familial environment was great.  I'd advise taking the trolley here from the Quarter and enjoying a hearty breakfast.  

Good coffee and big portions (except the waffles - they looked small but everything else was big!)

I had the Mexican omelet (see photo) and it was filling for sure - you can get with hashbrowns  (shown) or with grits."
170,_giq0ZVwDJpW7KoHQ2EiYg,"Love this place. Great breakfast, brunch, or lunch spot. Best waffles I have had, best hash browns.  Don't forget to get a freeze, or two, also. Worth the travel time from downtown"
171,Mm4FbyK32GXRGab2QxF1eg,"Great service, great food, great place to visit if you come to New Orleans! The waiters makes it original down home Nawlins! You will be entertained!"
172,xq3oAsxMckLfTG2IHRUnww,"We had the vegetarian omelette and the Rano's (egg whites and spinach), and decided to share it. Both were super cheesy and delicious, staff was friendly and quick to serve and replenish your beverages, I think it's a great breakfast joint but I saw burgers on the menu as well, may need to come back to try that!
Price was way below any restaurant around in the block."
173,53xFItI0px3nCf_mNQ_pAw,"They don't salt their fries. Even McDonald's does that.  I think I ordered poorly - hot roast beef poboy. Their ""sauce"" is super salty and the quality of the beef was on par with prison food. Great ambience and staff, though."
174,Ph7QxDjlhcg9d7uCL3aKXQ,"I was really excited to go here with my friends after a zoo trip, but it turned out to be a big regret. I would not recommend this place at all even though it is supposed to be a New Orleans classic.

Upon arriving, one of the staff members rudely told my friend that someone was already sitting there in one of the seats that she selected. We were all taken aback by his attitude bc it was uncalled for. When the customers arrived back at the counter, we found out that the seat was actually empty. 

We sat directly in the middle of the counter which gave a clear view of where everything was being prepared. I highly doubt that everything was sanitary at all. The counters and grill looked like it had not been cleaned in a really long time, on top of flies flying all over the diner and landing on everything. None of the staff were wearing gloves while preparing the food. I even saw one of them using his phone and then go on to prepare food without gloves and washing his hands. The aesthetic of the restaurant would be nice if it was clean. 

The wait was not long for food, however, I did wait 20 minutes for my fries but that was because I did not want to say anything and upset the staff who seemed to have forgotten that I ordered it. However, my friend's burger was so undercooked that it was probably still mooing and my other friend's onion rings were greasy, undercooked, and had a strange watery texture. I have no complaints about my french fries or mac and cheese bites, they were quite good but not extraordinary.

I do not recommend this place at all. It was my first and last time eating there. But, I do think that it is somewhere that you have to experience for yourself."
175,oHc8g8jBt7FQndd2LoDCsQ,"Wow! What a breakfast ,,,,,had the mushroom omlette with hash browns and a side of bacon ,,,with the chicory coffee,,,,omlette was a perfect mix of mushrooms and cheese ,,,,5 stars for the best omlette I ever had !!"
176,kvudrAVHJrfpx6tIIXlZzQ,"I ordered the chili omelet with grits, 3 pancakes and a pecan pie with ice cream. My meal came out with hash browns but was also accompanied with my grits which was outstanding but they forgot my pancakes. After being this to the attention of the head cook, he made my pancakes and did not charge me for them. Everything else was excellent even tho the venue is very tiny."
177,IUDsHtgQA-YvdQo-6yRppg,"This is the quintessential diner!  Food is great, the staff friendly and they cook right there!  Counter seating only and you end up talking with your neighbors!  My sister and I shared the muffuletta- good thing because it was huge!  We also shared cheese fries!  Didn't have room for dessert- next time!!"
178,wzHhyyFtlRhac-sQ278YGA,A review two years later for me...I'm glad I was able to visit while the late Marvin Day was around. He was truly a joy and brought all of the personality to the diner. Food is pretty average but the experience with Marvin was the best. WORD!
179,rZJq9-S3JOU2MFosKKN50w,"This is a New Orleans institution that has been located in the river bend area of New Orleans for decades. Located near the university area it has been a favorite spot for Tulane and Loyola students for years. It's an old fashion diner where you sit at the counter and order diner food. Great spot for breakfast, lunch or dinner but I usually find myself getting a cheeseburger, fries and a thick milkshake when I am there. If you plan on going for lunch/brunch on a weekend then be prepared to wait. This old style diner does not have a large seating area and fills up quickly. The food is very good but you are really eating there for the tradition and the experience. Ownership changed a few years ago but they have maintained the grill as a top New Orleans grease spoon and I look forward to going there for decades to come."
180,erJRIboipADPbTO2uj2uBA,"To start off, make sure that you're getting here early or that you're ready to wait. To follow up, it's worth the wait. I promise. We lucked out showing up at about 1130 on a Saturday and only had to wait about 20 minutes, but the line was to the street by the time we were seated. 

There are only about 30 seats in Camellia Grill. When you show up, just join the back of the line. They'll let you in the door as there is space available at the counter. 

I've always gone for the breakfast. The Chef's Omelet is a monster that is guaranteed to fill you up. Eggs, turkey sausage, ham, bacon, potatoes, cheese. Oh yeah, they top that off with chili. I ordered with fries instead of hash browns. The amazing thing about this is actually the eggs. Very rarely do you find eggs this fluffy. I think they blend them in a milkshake machine. Whatever they do, it works. The eggs are incredibly light and make up for the rest of the heavy stuff. 

I told a bit of a lie when I said I stick with breakfast. Pecan pie with ice cream isn't part of a normal balanced breakfast, but I had that too. The secret is they'll actually put your piece of pie on the grill in some butter and heat it up. Then you get it with ice cream. Works for breakfast for me. 

I did try a bite of the burger as well as the chocolate freeze. Burger was pretty standard diner burger, but good. Chocolate freeze was really good in my book. I like my shakes to be only slightly blended with bits of ice cream. Also, not overwhelmingly heavy. This was both."
181,icl_eKFspOVlsGhCZ82gnw,I've never had a bad thing from here! Everything is good! My favorite is the Word special which is a hot sausage poboy... I usually add cheese! BEST....EVER! And you can't go wrong with their breakfast!!
182,xCgpWu-FdQIUTZQ6x27l_Q,"The food here is delicious. Other than the rude hostess the staff is funny, pleasant and makes it a great trip. Had the ham cheese omelet. They have it down to a science. 
Friend had the bacon cheeseburger and it looked juicy and delicious. 
Tried the club sandwich and the carved turkey on it made it original."
183,csW3Z9rI9KecjDKA0pZccw,"I give Camellia Grill 2.5 stars.

Had a hankering for some diner type breakfast on a Sunday morning following a night of many beverages...so we decided on Camellia Grill.  It had been YEARS since I had been, and a little bit of nostalgia kicked in.

We went early, so the wait was only 5 minutes long.  Get there after 10, and you'll see a line out the door.

I ordered the ham and cheese omelet, and hashbrowns.  It was just o.k.  My boyfriend had a pancake and sausage. It was pretty good.

The prices are reasonable, but definitely not as cheap as people make it out to be.

I can't see ever making it point to go there again, as there are a ton of great breakfast options in New Orleans.  

I honestly can't figure out the hoopla."
184,wyUTuhCVN9L0aV0AXPeN3g,We took the trolley here for breakfast the morning of New Years Eve.  We arrived a little after 10 and the line was well out the door but I was surprised at how fast it moved.  I was also surprised when we got inside that the whole restaurant is one long counter.  Very cool.  I had scrambled eggs and hubby had what he called one of the best omelettes ever.  The servers were fast and friendly.  We had a really pleasant breakfast.  I recommend getting an RTA day pass and spending the day on your back from breakfast or lunch getting on and off the trolley through the garden district.  It was a nice way to work off our food.  My only comment would be that the only two cheeses are swiss and American.  I have long held the belief that American cheese is not in fact cheese.  Maybe I've been in the midwest too long but cheddar should be on the menu.
185,mXqZ4Jf9B5pnz5h17MhDcg,"One of my favorite places ever.  So charming, such great food..and the people who work there are the BEST.  This place is a MUST visit if you are in New Orleans.  Lived in NO for 2 years, and fell in love with the Camelia Grill.  Now, I come every year when I visit.  They opened one in the Quarter, but this is the original.  Love it!"
186,d-4QrFrO7G83tEcODyph4g,Old school dining at it's best with a staff that will make you smile/laugh.... And food that is southern comfort! Go there every visit to Tulane!
187,GEdadIaqvk23C9HCUuVv1Q,"I can't say enough great things about this place. It's so unique to uptown and has anything you could ever imagine to satisfy your cravings. I particularly like the omelettes, pancakes, and the catfish dinner. Their mashed potatoes are also heavenly. Aside from their good old fashion diner food, I just love all the servers. They are incredible and make you feel like home no matter where you come from. Do yourself a favor and stop by for some great food but an even better experience."
188,861yBEkjn4NRMFKo63mKTQ,This is the cutest diner ever. I love how the waiter orders up the food. I stuck with a BLT with an order of onion rings. The onion rings were perfect! Great environment and friendly service!
189,jsr70izlOHQ7MRtuMgE-qQ,"(10/2014) 
My second taste of Louisiana!  It's good ol' fashion simple home-style grill food.  The ambiance is a flash back to the 1940s with men in bow ties serving over-the-counter style.  Tried their gumbo, red beans and rice,  and muffaletta sandwich.  Seemed to be a popular spot as it was very crowded!"
190,HjCD7-kE8_YOja0aRZ6V1g,"This is another of those places where I think people are more enamored with the idea of the restaurant rather than the food. 

It's kind of dirty. And it smells like a toilet. I think they use the same industrial cleaner to clean the counters as they do the restrooms. I couldn't get past the smell.

The food is... diner food, but not even that great. It's just alright.

But the servers/cooks are cool and the place is dingy so people feel 'legit'.

True Americana..."
191,mcvY2yFROcOwDbsXfA0p7w,Arrived at around 2am. Totally ignored for 30 minutes. Almost had to speak to the manager. Took 45 minutes for food! Not a ghost ending to a great night !
192,NYG9i5vpq5P-V2in7LyLwA,"I came here on June 9th around 4:30pm along with 3 other friends . Upon walking in , this young gentlemen with glasses had the worst attitude . (His name started with a B.) My order was Mac & cheese bites and onion rings . The onion rings were disappointing since they were oily and stuck together . Maybe they had an off day . I don't see myself returning to this restaurant in the foreseeable future . There is nothing special about this place ."
193,Ywz2MCTXCrPNDG7cu3y7vA,"You CANNOT miss this place if you're visiting New Orleans! Yes, sometime the wait is long, but that's only because so many people love this place they are willing to wait a while to be seated. The waiters are just the funniest and friendliest people you will ever meet, and they don't do it just to get tips. These people are genuinely friendly and want you to have a good time in their establishment. Now, the food... Everything is good. They have some of the best burgers in the city, and their omelets are out of this world. I would give them 10 stars if I could!"
194,V87PwEAO2S84MFTPtenJkg,"small place but man the food is amazing. we had the fried catfish, the chef's omelet which was super ridiculously amazing (covered in chili) and mac n cheese bites. the staff working at 1-2 am is really funny and work super hard!"
195,Fsx5T_V_EcFyQYPYDlUELg,"Not sure where to start except to say WOW!!!  What a experience in food, quality, atmosphere and service.  This is a ""old time"" diner type venue and it lives it as soon as you walk in.  Went for breakfast and had a short wait and the food was served hot and fresh as it should be.  This is a MUST GO TO PLACE.....be ready for long lines on a busy weekend and it goes quick.  Our server MIKE is FANTASTIC.  They are all funny. witty and charming.....THANKS!!!!"
196,KhKATs_KOZjCsEsF_jMq1w,"Been here twice in my three visits to New Orleans. We just love it!  It is an experience not to be missed. I wouldn't recommend it to those snobby foodies - this is something completely different. 

You will leave full and with a smile on your face. 

You've got to a chocolate freeze!"
197,XNkyWWnqPYXVWjjQ10bWHA,"DON'T GO!!!
There are too many great places to eat in NOLA to waste a meal here.

Omlette burnt.
Asked for cheddar, got American even though they confirmed cheddar TWICE.
Fake syrup on the counter beside the liquid margarine.
Bland grits...almost the worst I've ever had."
198,dsTYMrQtuZ6_tGPTK2kOvA,"I went to New Orleans for my sister's graduation from Tulane this passed May.  I had heard wonders about this place so I was super excited.  When we got there we had a pretty short wait time (only couple head of my family of 5).  The host told us it would be only about 15 minutes, which was a good thing because my fiance was paying for parking.

As we waited several people finished their meals, and the couple in front of us was seated in an area for four people which I thought was strange because there was a seat for two in another location, and we were a bigger group.  

The next thing I know, the male host, who obviously hates his job, is yelling at my sister in law because we were waiting for my fiance to come back from the parking lot and he wanted to seat us. Then he started yelling at me because I asked him to sit closer to my family, not an unreasonable request.  He was going to sit us on opposite sides of the restaurant, unbelievable! 

I immediately told my Mom to get up, that we were leaving, There is no way, that I'm supporting a business who treats their patrons like that.  As we were walking out, I thank the host for such wonder service, and he told me a few choice words (real professional, what happened to the customer is always right?!?!).

I will definitely not go back there, New Orleans is full of great places to eat, where people give you that southern hospitality, and deserves you business,  Camellia's Grill certainly does not."
199,ml1P4qAo-7_3Ss5Gj9i8Ig,"I have been going to the Camellia for almost five years and after five years I will not return.  We took the trolly all the way from the French Quarter to Camellia's on a Saturday morning.  As we arrived about 10 to 15 people were standing out front of the restaurant with confused looks on there faces.  We walked in to the restuanut and the host told us to wait outside.  She did not take anyone's name nothing just said go outside.  Well, after a few minutes other guess started leaving saying other people that arrived after them where being seated before them.  We decied to wait and see if we were missing something and the couple who arrived after us got seated first.  We left and will never return.  All we wanted was for the host to take a name or give us a number simple as that but instead fight your way in and hope you get a table.  I could not believe the host, Wow!"
200,NAHhc7FTScoIuqRWcdq3_w,"I love this place!  I've been coming here since the 80's.  Every time I go to New Orleans this place is a must.  I normally get eggs and their pecan waffles (which are delicious) but it's mostly for the entertainment of the waiter.  On Friday, June 19, we were there and were not disappointed with our waiter, Marvin.  Shout out to Marvin.  People from my group had burgers and raved about them.  I had the ham & cheese omelet which was HUMONGOUS but really salty!  That was the downside.  Next time I will try a burger.  Anyway, I recommend this treasure."
201,Tsabj9a0-VacbO3bCssDaw,"Love The Camellia Grill! Although the food is good, it's the atmosphere that makes the experience worthwhile. They serve an extensive menu of breakfast and lunch items available all day. The dining area is small, so get there early because you will most likely have to wait. The seating is awesome because you can see everything happening right in front of you. The waiters always go above and beyond taking your order. They are hilarious: they sing, they yell (in a good way!), and they are just all around super friendly! 

Tip: Get the burgers and a shake!"
202,oLzYGnoGcoayTktHgW7Z2A,"Great atmosphere, great service, lively good time.  Belly up to the diner-style counter and settle in for coffee, great breakfast fare, and very entertaining banter from the guys behind the counter.

Took the ~30 minute ride on the St Charles Streetcar from Canal Street.  Had a GREAT breakfast, then slowly made our way back East with strolls through Audubon Park, Lafayette Cemetery, Garden District, and Magazine Street.  Buy a day-pass for the buses/streetcars, hop on and off.

I would absolutely put this on the list to visit.  We had breakfast there on a Thursday, showed up right at 8am, and had no problem immediately getting a seat.  By 830 or 900 it was filling up, but never hit capacity while we were there.  I can imagine Lunch and Dinner (plus weekend breakfast) probably get crazy.

Don't miss it."
203,sEL1sr-q2lWlwHXd_t2APw,"Leave Jackson Square when you're in NOLA!

This grill beckons a by-gone era with its waiters in white coats and seats around the dining counter, homemade ""freezes,"" and lunchroom dishes. If you find a wait, grab a place around the perimeter and pick up a paper menu at the register so you can place your order quickly once you find a spot and be considerate of the other poor folks who are waiting to eat this glorious food. Probably not the best place to eat during rush hours with a large group.

Who doesn't love breakfast at night? A three-egg chili cheese omelet answers the call, but tonight we had two versions of their hamburger, the One Eye Buck and a plain cheeseburger. You order all the trimmings separately from grilled onions or mushrooms to the lettuce and tomato ""dressed."" Condiments are added by you.

One Eye Buck: a fried egg--any way you want--sits atop their single hamburger with cheese. The egg brings a flavor punch. Some folks like it runny, I prefer hard.

Cheeseburger: I needed to add a little salt but the crisp outside of the grilled meat and tender inside complimented the grilled bun. 

Drinks: We were brought water first without asking---I had forgotten how nice that used to be. Straws are torn open by the waiters, offered and you pull your own out--one of my favorite gestures here. I opted for the mocha freeze instead of chocolate. It was light on the coffee flavor but delicious nonetheless. It's not billed as a milkshake so don't expect it. The subtle ""iciness"" is what the pre-made, constantly-churning machines in malls try to mimic but can't get the ice crystals small enough. Worth the try. 

Our waiter was friendly and efficient. 

You are given your paper order to ring up at the register. Don't let the ATM at the door confuse you. They do take cards.

Bathrooms are located through the kitchen storage area which was surprisingly clean and straight. The bathroom was clean, large and well-stocked. Although rubber mats line the way, you are walking through work space so be mindful of slippery floors that may have been mopped recently. 

Of course we will return."
204,K1MnBGz30t-L9BLLlznSKw,"Classic diner.  I would go here for the experience rather than the food. 

Also, plan on spending the rest of the day walking off that humungous plate of chili cheese fries, Doc double cheeseburger and chocolate freeze."
205,cw-jdsrnA55f1QZzx_rSeA,"So my friends had been talking this place up for YEARS, and the last time we went they were still closed post Katrina- finally got to go sit at the awesome counter and have chili cheese fries and a cheeseburger before an evening of indulging - so worth it!!!  All kinds of people come in, great people watching, quick service, and you are out the door stuffed, for not too many duckets."
206,gAaa0Hia93V4BCClT7aA1A,"Excellent service. Good Food.

Camellia Grill is a New Orleans classic! I have been going to Camellia Grill since I was an infant. The food and service is always great.

Camellia is perfect for a quick breakfast or a late night drunken nosh. If you are looking for the best of both worlds get a chilli cheese omelet with a side of fries and a chocolate shake."
207,VJX02pgGk52ZN_cf9Cu07w,"I'd passed by this place in Uptown for many years, but never stopped in until the week after New Year's 2018.  Only in New Orleans would you find a diner with marble counters and white cloth napkins.  I didn't expect anything at all--the place is not at all expensive.  The service here is particularly gracious and helpful and poised, even for old New Orleans.  

I ordered their 'Tutti's Cheese Omelette'.  I was shocked when it arrived and I realized that I had never had an omelette in my life like this one:  it was like eating a cloud made out of omelette, not leathery and dry and overcooked like omelettes invariably are anywhere else.  The cheese melted and ran through the toothsome and delicate omelette perfectly.  

My friend ordered the pecan pie a la mode.  Here at Camellia Grill the chef (I can't refer to him merely as a short-order cook) prepared everything on the same grill; in this case that means that he warmed the pecan pie on the same griddle where he cooks the hamburgers.  When I watched this proceeding, I thought, ""These people are either crazy or brilliant.""  I know pecan pie, I grew up in the South, and this was the best pecan pie I've ever had in my life.  I don't know how it works, but the result speaks for itself.  The grill preparation of the pie somehow toasts the pecans so that it is genius.  I can't stop thinking about it.  

New Orleans is like that:  a marvelous environment for unexpected pleasant surprises.  I only wish I could have stayed longer and experienced the entire menu."
208,5pXnJbMyCzAjMrBUWfi3XQ,"Too crowded to find a place for four together and one of the line cooks kept rapping. I don't mind rap but his lyrics just weren't going anywhere. Rap was bad, but food was good.  GET THE ORANGE JUICE"
209,NkYEYQk8eQi-TJeDn470sA,"I'd give it a worse score but the place is clean and the service prompt. The reuben- listed as a 'whole meal sandwich' was $2 more than the menu google showed me and i got 2.5 tough slices of corned beef (wish i took a picture). If you looked at what i paid $10 for you'd call me an idiot and that's how i feel. What a waste of money. 

Speaking of waste of money- don't bother spending $5 on the mac&cheese bites ( also $2 more on the menu than on google)

Feeling worse when you leave than when you came in sucks. I live uptown and in new orleans for 10yrs now and i feel like a sucker. Maybe see what people around you are eating bc its cleared what i paid $18 (w tip) was no where near worth it. A restaurant w a $ symbolizing the price and being a heralded historic diner in town left me feeling cheap and used. Bravo chef."
210,kMxIeAmEzkjhYZrKAnAAww,"Pecan waffle + over medium egg + fresh orange juice = breakfast of champions.

The true diner feel and staff are what make this spot a gem. The breakfast food is (and seems) delicious by the line out the door at all times, and the servers are there to charm you - and they will!

Darling spot :)"
211,su8bRjztM1F7s1SZdCUspg,Simple good food at a low cost in a fun atmosphere. We enjoyed our breakfast here before a Saints game.  I do admit my order was wrong (I ordered the pecan waffle and received pancakes) but it was quickly corrected with an apology and the pancakes were on the house.  Free pancakes are never a bad thing.
212,g0F1VME40tftJ0wgNX7VaQ,"We only stopped to have the pie. And what an experience. If you want to experience a good ""southern"" chocolate pecan pie with a glob of ice cream - stop here. How they prepare the pie is a real hoot!!

I would go back to have plenty of other things on the menu - omelets, waffle, chili cheese fries. Forget the diet and just enjoy it all!"
213,zWu_qKBUa4hZ5sVLp6qf6Q,"Went here for the first time and thought it was ok, but definitely won't go back. 

I admit that I am a breakfast snob.  I want strong coffee and complicated breakfast goodness.  The coffee here was strong, but the complicated breakfast goodness really fell into the category of complicated for me to get what I wanted. 

Our server was entertaining.  He forgot nearly everything we ordered and then barked when we tried to get our own straw.  I liked him, honestly, but think he's in the wrong job.  The actual cook was rock solid which meant that he managed to cook the right food even if our server couldn't remember where to deliver it. The relationship between the various staff members is a high point.  

The food was good, probably would have been better if we'd gotten what we ordered.  And that's probably why I'm tart on this place.  After perusing the menu, my instinct was to skip the breakfast and go straight to the banana cream pie.  I decided to be a grown-up and eat breakfast, but leave room for the pie, which I got to go. 

Sadly, instead of banana cream pie to go, I got cheesecake to go.  Seriously lame!  I can get cheesecake anywhere, but banana cream pie is scarce!"
214,DFL3kP0sf91a5cYZOuEXIQ,"Camellia Grill has gone downhill.  Had a cheese omelette that I really used to look forward to (fluffy with a lot of cheese that practically filled the plate). Instead I was served a flat small omelette that was about a third of the size....very disappointed.  IMHO, Camellia Grill is living OFF its reputation from the past but is not living UP to it."
215,HCv9ZTmz3khkkbsStldsiw,"Really good, end of story.  Could be a little cheaper only complaint."
216,07CgQJFCm1v4PMyAesQ1Aw,"The food is nothing special (they were out of pecan pie), let's just be honest. At least for breakfast. It was standard diner food, if anything a bit below. 

But the set-up is cool and the servers authentic - shouting the orders and having personality with their customers. 

The price is right though and I do love a place that servers french fries as a standard side dish at breakfast."
217,dy7aQIjjgnlowapnUHbLUA,"This was our last stop...waiting in the wings to offer us yet another slice of heaven.
And that slice here comes in the form of their amazing cheesecake. Yes...the cheesecake. Just do it.
Cheeseburgers, fries, chocolate shake...and cheesecake. 
Loved the sweet southern hospitality, the true-to-the 50's diner in what looks like a LA style old mansion. 
If your staying closer to French Quarter or around...take the trolley! 
So fun."
218,GfyjZ529aV9ZK6J8UkFLtw,"The female server with long braided hair obviously hates white people!! She had an attitude from the word go! She did not say hello, good morning, hi or anything and when I said good morning she didn't respond. She took out the order sheet , leaned over on the counter and waited for me to order. She didn't ask if I was ready to order or what would I like or anything. She just stood there and looked at me until I ordered. I asked for a straw for my water and she just looked at me and didn't give me the straw until after I ordered. Then it was handed to me with an attitude! After I received my food she didn't check on me once. Didn't ask me if I wanted a refill on coffee or water or how was my food. It's very apparent that she hated white people!! I sat at the middle counter and she and another server stood to my left cursing and Using the ""F"" word and carrying on with no regard for customers. On the other hand , the cook did ask me if everything including my food was ok and I responded yes! My server has no business working in a restaurant or in the hospitality industry at all!! Camelia grill gets five thumbs down from me!!"
219,tvX9owIjsyCTMOVBL_ucgQ,"Loved this place. We were on a hunt for the best milkshake in New Orleans back in May and The Camellia Grill did not disappoint. We tried the cherry and orange freezes and both were delish!  The onion rings were also quite good. Our waiter Marvin was personable and quick. It was an all-around great experience. 

(Quick note to say: riding high on that milkshake buzz, we took our friends who were not with us to the location near the French Quarter so they could try the shakes. We had the worst service in the history of service there, including a waiter who was so drunk we thought he was going to get sick right in front of us. So definitely stick with the this location!)"
220,rD6kclB7QD0G0uQufYileg,"Sadly, their French Quarter location has closed, but you get the same taste and experience at this location. The wait can take a while if you get there at the wrong time, especially if there are more than a couple of you, so be prepared to hang around until there's an opening at the counter. One of the musts of The Camellia Grill is the chocolate freeze. It's like a milkshake but icier and thus more refreshing. Omelettes and hashbrowns are great, and I was eyeing my neighbor's pancakes all morning. They also have fried mac n cheese, which is a fun, greasy treat."
221,YEVnW6gJ9Hde6CYHF_u8iw,"Camellia Grill is the only local diner I frequent. It has a great classic feel with only bar style seating and service available.

It could be the chocolate freezes, but it's probably a combination of that and the friendly service,  clean kitchen,  and great breakfast that makes this my goto  breakfast-served-all-day spot (but mostly it's the choclate freezes. )

I really like the waffle, even though it is thin and far from my preferential Belgian style.   The syrup tastes real,  but I'm not sure if it is actual maple or a good copy.   

The omlets are awesome. They mix everything up and cook the mix into supper fluffy decadent eggs.   

Camelia Grill is a great stop for breakfast!  Not in the mood for breakfast?  They also have great okra gumbo, classic grilled cheese, good burgers, and some other options I haven tried like fried chicken strips and hot dogs."
222,6Cv5FqhZ_blaeZxP6qQ13g,"Camellia Grill - 7:40 a.m. My group of 20 ALMOST first in line. Enter promptly @ 8:00 with 3 dozen or so others.  Waiter juggles silverware as he sets the counter.  Order omelette - holy cow!  Just cheese & mushroome, but filled the plate.  Came w/fries & I ordered grits also.  I'm in NOLA, right?   Verrrry good.  After seeing pecan waffle wished I had room for that too.  Bought 3 t-shirts, 1 for me and 2 for daughters.
Returned 3 days later on my own.  Long line, but since I had a cane, a generous (local?) person moved me up, then held place so I could sit on porch and wait.  Had that pecan waffle this time.  Poured what I thought would be syrup - turned out to be melted butter - on waffle and ENJOYED!  Coffee so-so.  Should have tried a freeze - stronly recommended by everyone.  Will next time.  And there WILL be a next time.  I'll get there one way or another.  Yes, cholesterol city, but watch your diet before & after, you don't want to miss this!"
223,S6JhW-p7p3TFxvsx5o0SGw,"Great for families, good reasonable prices, fun/friendly staff, big variety.
We stayed in New Orleans a couple days after our cruise earlier this week.  With the Sugar Bowl and Saints game, the town was very rowdy, but we found a couple family-friendly gems.  Camille Grill was one of them.  When we arrived at 6:00 pm a party of about 30 was leaving so the entire restaurant was empty, by the time we left it was filled up again.  I had the Mardi Gras; Corned Beef and Turkey on Rye (held the bacon) with their version of Thousand Island dressing and it was outstanding.  Also enjoyed a local beer.  My wife had a Turkey Reuben (not on the menu) and she loved it, kids split chicken strips and fries.  The waiter (Joshua?) was sharing local ghosts stories that scared the heck out of our kids (in a good way), and we actually went to one of the sites he discussed (that really scared our kids).  He also was goofing around with our kids (also in a good way).

The seating is stools at a counter and the chef/cook is right there, feels like a flash back to a soda shop in the 50s/60s.  We completed the meals with  chocolate cream pie (they were out of banana) and we devoured it.  Next time in NewOrleans we'll be back here!!"
224,_Uk8eM_oNpCLYG-JnC-ALA,"It's a dam good thing I don't live in New Orleans because if I did I'd be at this joint every single day and that would eventually lead to my death. I don't get me wrong it's a great way to go.
Death by fluffy delicious ginourmous omelet followed up with a chocolate pecan pie in an authentic diner/greasy spoon is a death that I just might aspire to."
225,F8ltVEM7ZwSc8nnDLu8YgQ,"Probably one of the best burgers I have had in a long time! You have a wait a bit to get a seat, but it is well worth the wait. This was a true American Diner experience. Will, our waiter, was awesome! He gave us the royal treatment and was very entertaining. Camellia Grill is a must do when visiting NOLA."
226,elskdV90F2ll3E9UuCbPnQ,"First time back since college and it was so worth it. We stopped for breakfast on our way home. It's diner sitting so sometimes you have to wait a bit. I had the corned beef hash omelet that was the bomb! My granddaughter ate the pancakes and loved them. You go, you eat, you leave. The food is just good home cooking and the staff is attentive."
227,HTji1Ehn2L0RpjUsLr8Xhw,It's been 15 years since I went to Camellia Grill so things may have changed. But I still dream of this place. Fantastic! Best grits anywhere. And pecan pancakes... I used to wait in long lines for breakfast there and never have I been anywhere else where I wanted to wait in a line since. I hope it's still as good as it used to be!
228,NtZHGzXq2X9iJeRE5Px4Bg,"My wife and I had breakfast there. Both had omelets, grits, and hash browns. Omelets were top notch, one of the best I have ever had. Grits were very good, hash browns needed a longer cook to get them crispy.

Service was quick and easy going."
229,IyU4zpJTZHSg9FHc8-5l0Q,"I am truly dumbstruck as to why this is so highly lauded. Yes, its got the diner kitsch experience. Yes, its in the Quarter. But, really?? The food is not that great. In fact, its barely passable. I should add, I only ate there once on my most recent visit, but so not worth the money, calories or later discomfort.
Went there on the recommendation of several locals and after reading the reviews. It helped that it was less than two blocks from our hotel and we were in dire need of breakfast. I wanted the mexican omelette minus the beef. Seems like no big deal, right. I was told they couldn't do that because all the specialty omelettes were pre-mixed?!? Really unnecessary, but explains why the taste and texture was reminescent of powdered eggs. Eventually they were able to special order me a mexican omelette less beef and it was ok but I wouldn't order it again.  Especially when it cost more than the mexican omelette with beef! The fact that the breakfast then found me spending the rest of the day in the hotel room next to the facilities would ensure that I would never go back to sample any of their other offerings.
Maybe this place does a better burger, but for breakfast there are so many better options in the Quarter."
230,ZlnrFjldJBzzZfYnNTEzzA,"Man oh man - had 30 minutes- ran in and had the ""tuna"" and a tea! Good lord these people make TUNA FISH!!!! You will not be sorry!"
231,8H7GGvHxVcIaN_9tegp-Kw,"We were staying in the French quarters so it was a trip to come out here (later I saw one by Jackson square and my friends wanted to kill me ha oops). The whole area is beautiful and perfect for a stroll with a full stomach (which will happen). The whole set up was a little awkward because it's not tables. Its a bar and you sit where you can. Not convenient with a lot of people since you might have to split up for seats. The cooks are great guys and it definitely feels very authentically Louisiana. They cook in front of you (which turned out to actually be a little gross...so much grease, no gloves, etc). I didn't mind because I knew what I was coming for some real southern cooking but my friends were turned off...until they tasted their meal. Worth it hands down. A must on any New Orleans trip!

I had the muffuletta with cheese fries. Definitely recommend. BEST APPLE PIE EVER."
232,wfvqUlu9a3iTBe4x2hWSkw,Camellia Grill is the king of diners! It has one of the best (and least expensive) burgers I've ever had. It also boasts some of the best omelets I've ever had. If you are really hungry (or possibly hungover) get the Chef's Special Omelet. It will wake up your taste buds and fill that stomach up with greasy hearty goodness!
233,8Y6Pc9pmY0wvHcOT1Xerxw,"Best short order grill in the city!!!! Open till 2 or 3 in the morning. Highly recommended for any time. Great place with friends or family. The same locals have worked there for 40-50 years (Don't forget to give them daps). Runs like a machine. Best is their pecan pie, re-heated on the griddle in butter (sounds gross, but is a treat)"
234,kg0XzGLGKpn0Pi0YHd3ryg,"This was a GREAT place to eat on our first visit to NOLA! It was recommended in Frommer's and on Yelp! and it didn't disappoint. It's a small counter. I think I counted around 20 seats. There are some benches to sit on to wait for a seat. It was late enough that there were four spots for us when we arrived. The guys behind the counter were super friendly and the service was top-notch too. My wife and I got burgers and fries and the boys got breakfast. Well, if eggs and bacon/sausage with fries are breakfast. Lol. It's standard diner food but it's not your standard diner quality. The burger was juicy and full of flavor. The fries were plentiful and just the right golden crisp. There are many ways to make your burger unique, including the must of a fried egg on top. The shakes were also great. If you're in NOLA, this place is a must stop."
235,3S6wvZ14_WNsCCQBt5RQDA,"This is a really charming place. Definitely brings you back to old school dining. The way it is laid out are bars or counters that you can sit at and someone will arrive to take your order. The friend I was with warned me that it was always crowded but we went late on the 4th of July and there was hardly anyone in there so we were seated very quickly.

I had the catfish sandwich which was amazing and chilli cheese fries that I wasn't a big fan of. I really looked around while I ate because the old time decor was really fun to look at. I didn't try any of their desserts but it looked divine.

The reason Camellia's doesn't get 5 stars is because they ended up overcharging me for my meal even after I clarified it with the waiter. I don't want to cause a scene over $3 so I will probably never go back here after that. It is a shame because I really enjoyed my experience up until that little snafu."
236,67g-61XRmmdNh1Ks8_tr3Q,Love the Camellia grill come hunger and don't think about calories. Don't forget the homemade shakes and Pecan pie
237,gDjfjixZXabeLCdEbzNwuA,"Meh.  Pecan Pie was good, but I feel like the omelettes and breakfast were kind of mediocre.  The omelettes were huge, but they taste like velveeta and kind of cafeteria-ish.  The chocolate shake was nothing special, definitely had better (tastes like cheap icecream). Wouldn't go here normally unless I'm hungry late at night....so I guess it's good for late-night eats."
238,_7KP7ZePxJNLGSFW_Ct_JQ,Excellent food. Excellent service from Michael! Got a sausage and cheese omelette with hash browns. Tried the cheese omelette with grits.  Both very tasty.  Get there early to get the grits!
239,G_AZxt9x-45ohlaFZBfuOQ,My and My cuzzin ate here after a night of bar hoppin in NOLA and the food was GREAT!!! The late night servers were soooooo nice and handsome!!! I wished I could have packed one of those guys in my suitcase and brought him back here to the city!!!! LMAO!!!
240,wGTmiW0CpbUMwtu_L4vPzg,"Everything was amazing! Bacon cheese burger, fries, onion rings, grilled cheese for the kids and Brandon gave the boys milkshakes on the way out. Amazing food, amazing service!!"
241,wJzeFqtuuNz83qtPY9ulcQ,"Always a must on our trips to NOLA.  Great breakfast and friendly staff.  Arrive early.  Otherwise prepare to wait.  Our counter neighbors enjoyed a chocolate pie for dessert.  Looked yummy and they left very happy.  So did we.  I will add, though, that watching the food being prepared with bare hands made me a little anxious."
242,n4hSYQ-hpizkMqC8u9Y6rw,Late nights or recover mornings aren't complete without Camellia Grill. Great greasy in the good way comfort food.
243,Wiqr0xFuMq3ivberRqgXsQ,"LOVED this place. Once we discovered it we went here for breakfast every morning. Staff is energetic and friendly. Food is great. Only problem that I can see is the wait you have sometimes, but with food this good it's worth it."
244,HqgTutUTKuN0NbAkLED5yQ,"Beware! Recent health code violations in July 2014.  Entire family became ill after eating there on Sunday night.  We had burgers! Unfortunately illness delayed our travel home & the only constellation or not from the GM ""Ronnie"" was that he would take care of us when we returned.  Are you kidding me, we are never going back! Complaint has been filed with the state.
Customers taken for granted!"
245,DEO-7bLwCybxcrwIhImZTQ,"One eyed buck burger with bacon and cheese. The bacon was really fatty, but the patty and bun were phenomenal. This was good, affordable hangover food. Cheese fries, fried Mac and cheese, etc.  Next time I'm getting breakfast."
246,mnZUlKpZIhA4u0LL5FbhfA,"I was really looking forward to trying this place for breakfast while my family and I were in New Orleans. I ordered a ham and cheese omelet WELL DONE with grits and toast, my husband ordered a slice of the famous pecan pie. Our son had a waffle and omelet also, and our daughter had a burger. The omelet came soft and not well done. It also had a really weird texture, it did not taste like it was made with real eggs. Furthermore, the omelet and the pecan pie tasted like residue from a dirty grill/griddle. The whole restaurant looks very messy and unclean. Also we did not see anything entertaining with the staff as several people have commented on Yelp. I really wanted to like this place but we all left sorely disappointed."
247,pEPoTKHgXgA4lGkPe0NeGQ,"We both had the SW Omelette.  Very good and the grits were excellent.  Counter seating.  Fun to sit on a stool and watch the cooks work the grill.  Very attentive service.  Definitely recommend for breakfast.  More expensive than Waffle House, but atmosphere is worth the extra couple $'s.  We will try them for lunch next time we are in NOLA, as the grilled hamburgers they were cooking looked very tasty.  Street parking at $1 per 30 minutes was fine for us, as we were on our way to airport.  If you stay downtown, the St. Charles streetcar takes you right by this restaurant.  $3 for a full 24 hours of streetcar access is NOLA's best bargain."
248,Fj1BYKcWv-SN5TtkTSkDpQ,"This place is exactly why I love New Orleans.  It's one of a kind.

There are no tables, just a long, winding counter and a line outside of customers eager to take a place there.  Servers check off your order on a detailed note pad and shout it behind them to cooks who frantically slap patties on the grill, dunk potatoes in the fryer and whirl ice cream in the blender until your meal is complete.

The food is fresh and hot, though pretty ordinary diner food.  My BLT was loaded with bacon; my husband's burger was juicy and warm.  Our chili-cheese fries were still crispy under their blanket of deliciousness.  The chocolate freeze was thick and high-quality, made with Blue Bell ice cream.  There are a few NOLA-specific nods on the menu; we enjoyed the gumbo (on the light side, and a little too much rice for me.)

As we ate, we chatted and fist-bumped with various servers who came to check on us.  One offered free advice: ""It's all in ya head,"" he said sagely, after we commented on the beautiful weather and atmosphere here.  ""Ya think positive, ya gonna live positive.""  He continued this speech as a quasi-soliloquy as he went off in search of banana cream pie, and since the only piece left was a little thin, he cut us half a piece of coconut too.  They were both out of this world, and to this moment I regret every bite we left on our plates.

Yes, it's just a diner.  And no, it's not.  It's so much more."
249,N7GD3w_8DN1Rvuc0-GyQQg,A Nola tradition and everyone should go at least once for a trip back in time.  Very good location with lots of Nola charm.  The food is always good.  Easy parking.  The lines are not too bad and you can be seated in about 15-20 minutes even when the line is out the door.  Went here starting 35 years ago and will go again soon...............
250,VzsXev0aBdjyGZf8YuApPg,"In addition to the food being fantastic, our server, Leon, was easily the best server I've ever had. Super entertaining, super sweet, and incredibly good at his job. The line cook he was working with, Chris, was fantastic as well. I absolutely loved this experience and would recommend The Camellia Grill to anybody visiting NOLA!"
251,G--qxWL08lGjXOjYeMBYYg,Food tastes ok but portions are small and it's pretty expensive for what you get. Service at the Metairie location is good. And the food is good enough but won't be going back due to overpricing.
252,wWBJzz-HBxqQYU6JK6f_Sg,"Stopped in for a post 11pm meal in the riverbend area and ended up at Camellia. The food here is not that great but the entertaining service normally makes up for the food but not on this night. I ordered the chef special omelet that was just ok, it was similar to an egg cake really with ingredients that were so chopped and overcooked that the contents of the omelet was indistinguishable to the omelet from the one my friend had next to me. The taste was ok but really was just the taste of eggs cheese and salt. The side hash browns came late and were coated in salted butter, no grits at night so I really made a bad choice in ordering eggs at night. What normally makes up for the food here is the great service but on this night the service was terrible. Ordered bread-never got it, ordered drinks-had to ask twice before I got it, ordered an extra cup of chili to wake up the omelet- never got it. The food, ambiance and normal wait to get a seat is not worth it if the crowd is not a little drunk and the service is not great and entertaining. On this night it was a rather bad experience and puts in question if I will come back again. Thank Zeus McDonalds will have 24hr breakfast starting Oct. 6."
253,UNpA_KoAYK8yVbGO7F6pAA,Not good. I always hear that this is the place to go for late night meals. I was obviously not drunk enough to see that the food served was really really hard and old. Yuck.
254,sW0shSAZYusaqnsF2VFNeg,"Best burger I've ever had! I ordered the One-Eyed Buck with cheese and bacon. I'm fact, we both ordered the burger, cheese fries, and the chocolate and chocolate- cherry freezes. I'm so glad we stopped here."
255,5y6V0R5luWL8k2xumkB8_g,"Long lines at peak times. Loud atmosphere... Yeah, doesn't matter. Still one of the best diners/grills in the country.

I don't care what you order, it will be great. But if you don't order the chocolate pecan pie for dessert? I don't want to be your friend any more. We're through."
256,kNexAEhq_D3qbjS7vAs-eg,"The service, the ambiance, the nostalgia and of course, the food! It reminded me of being a kid and eating at Woolworth's soda counter. The servers were so friendly and the food was so good we went back the next day! So many good places to eat at in NOLA and this one is just as special."
257,nmzhpDRGl047Bj1M-tGhcQ,"The food is good, the portions are large and the staff members are great.
Pretty much expect greasy, delicious diner food. It's nothing fancy, and they don't pretend to be.
I received so much food that I wished I had a second stomach, because I wanted to eat every last bite. It all just tasted so good that I didn't want to stop.
My favorite part was the staff. It's almost a meal and a show. I enjoyed watching them work together, dashing back and forth behind the bar, the most organized chaos. Our server, Will (with the pink bow tie), was friendly, happy and efficient.
The decor had paintings of the cooks and servers on the walls that gave the impression that these people have been working there for years, and that really, they are what makes up Camellia's.
Everything was just fantastic!"
258,ZHY2O6fgOROjiellVNy1rQ,"This place is one of, if not the, most overrated restaurant in New Orleans.  The experience is unique and fun, yeah. The food is not good.  The chili cheese fries are disgusting and most of the other things I have tried have been either disappointing or fantastically disappointing.  I'm from Northern New Jersey and this is no a diner, which it is clearly trying to be.  That being said, it may be worth a visit purely for the atmosphere and if you're in town visiting, just to say you went."
259,hfZP3r-oPDkI54-NVAOmJA,"I was in NOLA for work last week. I have to say my colleagues and I ate here everyday!! The food was so fantastic for a ""greasy spoon"". The staff were awesome especially ""Peanut"" he was professional and fun to deal with!! One day he had to do double duties as the waiter and the cook!!! The price was right on mark for the amount of food you received!!"
260,RtRwD5xPyQ-PJtXKIz7frQ,Outstanding meal and great atmosphere. A New Orleans tradition. Best breakfast in town
261,xNE3s6Zs9vErFUmR-2n_qQ,"This was a fun experience - service was fast despite the chaotic and crowded ambiance, and I enjoyed my sandwich! The food seemed simple and not exceptional, but I can definitely see why the restaurant is a popular attraction with lines out the door."
262,ikI_wLNfEB7J82j8qtWRGw,Great service. Good food. Burgers fresh and not frozen. Freezes are basically milkshakes to a midwestern girl. Family friendly.
263,wMqmFG3rHtC8Jt4FgXtVaQ,"The food at Camellia Grill really hits the spot--but the reason for the 5 star rating is the ""Camellia Grill Experience.""

This is what a diner should be; greasy, cheap, fast, simple yet delicious and totally what you might be craving after a night out on Frenchman's or at Maple Leaf or wherever else you may have found yourself getting into trouble the night before. There are always four familiar faces working behind the counter--I've been in about a dozen times and every time every one working is on top of their game. If nothing else, they have this thing down. It's impossible to leave Camellia Grill hungry and it's also impossible to leave without a smile. If you're visiting NOLA you can't go wrong here and it's also a ""kid-pleaser.""

My suggestions:
-Get a Freeze
- Any type of pie 
- Any of the HUGE omelets 
- Onion rings
- Pecan waffle with bacon or sausage 

(I promise I have never eaten these things all in one visit...)"
264,2xZf1UNB3-KKSV0_UYvlcg,"Whats not to love? The servers are a kick, the food is delicious, and they have butter in a syrup dispenser. 
Beautiful. 
Pricing is good, atmosphere is divey, and they actually take credit cards!"
265,DmDUk_tuDCOuGiiGUS8tJg,This was always the go to spot for great breakfast when I was in school in New Orleans - first trip back in 20 years and nothing has changed - still  the best place for breakfast and the show the waiters put on - so - you can go home again!
266,gE51AdMvTKECHsMc_wBhow,"Old Time Fun is all I can say...I recently discovered this place and liked it so much I ate there twice in the same day (breakfast and dinner)!  The portion sizes are great for the amount you pay.  My brother got the Chef's Special Omelet both times.  And the pecan pie was soo good I had to take a piece to go as well.  The staff is friendly and engaging.  The line cooks are fast and clean.  Its counter top dinner style seating is perfect for this place.  You may have to wait but its worth it.

I also loved that you can reach this great location by taking the St. Charles Street Car which takes you from Downtown all the way through the Garden District.  Get the $3 day pass and see the city."
267,K70uWWszLgWetkrgva_7zA,"Nom Nom Nom... this place was so very tasty! I was taken here by a local for a laaate breakfast on a Monday and had the best meal of my trip! 

Any place that serves butter in a syrup dispenser is aces in my book! I had the orange freeze and a pecan waffle and was full for the entire day after. 

From the moment you sit at the counter, the servers are all so funny and engaging, This was the ultimate diner experience!"
268,5D_hDo_TD8tPfLPvJAcogA,"Tasty food, not the type you can get just anywhere. I had the chili cheese omelet, as good as it was the last time I had it, even though its been years. Camellia is just a different experience--and in this case, different is good."
269,DgPG3OEIbLsVHasn32OOAA,"I'm sorry all you die hard fans, I just don't get it. I am by no means a native but I'm married to one and have lived in NOLA for 7 years, I can't believe this place is considered a local institution. The fact that it's a counter diner is cute but the food and the service is just bad. Imagine that everything you eat is cooked in that liquid butter flavored topping they serve at the movie theater, that it's so disgustingly dirty your kind of afraid to look at the grill, and the service is about as friendly as the check out girl at Walmart (like they'd rather be sleeping or doing anything that doesn't involve the inconvenience of working). I choked down about 4 bites of my omelet just so my friend who suggested the place wouldn't feel bad but I am not exaggerating when I tell you I'd rather eat at ihop or dennys. At least the plates aren't obviously dirty. And for those yelpers who said they serve warmed BUTTER in pitchers, that is not butter my friends! That is liquid margarine. YUCK!  Trust me, I grew up in the restaurant business, I know the difference. The best part of this experience was visiting with my friend. I'm glad I went so I can check it off my bucket list but unless I am literally starving I will never eat here again. Especially with a city full of so many delicious breakfast places."
270,bSdM-nV_oiGUy3oJ0WPW0w,"Nice place. The food is good. Ordered the catfish Po-boys, gumbo, and cheesecake. The rice is tough in the gumbo."
271,_mqEcFzrUxJxi08opJFJ8w,"I sold myself on a few places before our trip to New Orleans, this was one and I was hoping for more. The red beans were pintos and had been cooked down for several days. They came with a thin piece of over cooked chicken. My partner had a salad which was deemed "" Chef"" but was pitiful. It would probably be better to stick with burgers or breakfast. The service was friendly and attentive and the ice water was big and cold with a refill without asking. Outside looks upscale but inside is worn and not very clean. Better at waffle house."
272,BnX-IgWg8UfSAEH8GvKZRA,"Was brought here by a local for a friday evening get together and was excited after reading all the reviews. 

1. Ordered the Coffee Freeze and was a little disappointed. It was not as delicious as I had hoped. It did not taste very coffee like at all and seemed watered down.
2. Had the Manhattan Omelet which was tasty and the fries that came with it were cooked just right. 
3. the other half had a burger and said it was good. Next time I will have to try one as well. 
4. Our waiter was a little pushy because when we asked him to take a picture of us he made us put up the menus to ""represent"" where we were. 

Had a good first time experience here, will definitely come back for some late night action and try the other things on the menu. Good spot to just pig out and eat with friends."
273,9dTcnRa_NfkBWMntIaXPmg,this was the best breakfast in New Orleans. THE BEST! as I looked online to find a good breakfast place I saw this in the cute looking house place and we had to come here. everything was amazing and it wasn't expensive! it's always the cute small cheap places that really are the best :) I will for sure be back here when back in New Orleans!
274,Ua8iIaTaDSQ1xznjT8CvAQ,"I ate lunch here every day for the 3 years I went to high school across the street at Franklin. You really don't come to Camellia for the food, although the freezes and omelettes are excellent, but for the entertainment. The waiters here are absolutely amazing. You really have to experience it.... so classic."
275,agFnRMIfNDvp9lVT8viHDQ,"My husband and I both ordered the cheeseburger, onion rings, and a soda, and we were loving every single bite!!  These fellas really have this classic combo down :-)

The atmosphere was very enjoyable as well.  The guys really are fun to watch.  They interact with each other and the patrons in such a way that just makes you feel good to be there.

I would definitely go back if I'm ever in New Orleans."
276,FbYYz-LhxkASNV_R2JVeJg,"Greasy food but really good. Very friendly wait staff and fun ""diner""type experience. Has breakfast menu all day long."
277,0-EBfFlFK2lAKn8rJ1OGGw,"A locally famous spot that my friend who lives there likes to go to. It is a walk away from his old place and right where the street car end of line is. It is a pleasant surprise and has this old school diner feel. Right down to the uniforms. Best part is the touristy kind of feel is mitigated as it is far away from that. 

Traditional breakfast is spot on. Pancakes are larger than what I'm used to. Its one of those serving sizes where I love it when I start eating it but end up hating pancakes when I am done. This is also the first time I had pecan pie for dessert after breakfast. At no other time in my life did I have dessert following breakfast. 

The biggest negative is the wait in line. If you aren't there at the right time it can take forever due to the counter seating only format. I also feel hurried as a result of this. There is no ""take your time"" rather it's "" hurry up and eat. For this I take off two starts. French quarter location has the same situation. I don't get it sometimes."
278,SXeG9sEmSc87ZirVI_30ew,"I was recommended to this ""place to eat"" by my hotel desk as part of my  St Charles Trolly ride thru the Garden District. I as expecting a fancy place, and was surprised that it was basically a small diner. Ha.. what a surprise, I had a Cat Fish Po Boy and it was crisp and fine, no grease, etc. 
Even though I am sure all the food is great, the high light of the experience was the staff.. its like being served by the Harlem Globe Trotters, Great guys, Great attitudes, Great everything. a refreshing pleasure, what Fun.
I had an excellant Pecan Pie, made on-site by a nice young fellow..(forgot his name now) people come back time and again. all the guys are great !
My advice, take the Trolly ride, and stop here for lunch or breakfast...you'll have a ball

I even took a picture of the guys which i hope to post."
279,1SUVYB9nQlFE-nTwsW4Gvg,"I cannot believe it took me so long to finally experience Camilia Grill.  I've driven by more times than I can count and every time commented on how I wanted to go there, but the line always intimidated me.  

This weekend, after a training run and a short street car ride to the magical place where St. Charles meets the river, I wasn't going to let the line get in my way.  I'd recommend grabbing a beverage for the wait and bringing along an entertaining dining companion, because it'll make your experience much more enjoyable. 

Everyone sits at the bar and then the cooks go to work grillin while providing excellent entertainment.  Our guy was giving us daps and throwing out lots of ""it's all gravy baby"", ""word!"", etc...he cracked me up.  I went with the veggie omelette sans mushrooms....I was speechless for a couple of seconds, then I dug into the greasy goodness.  Some of the cheese escaped and made friends with my french fries....which is never a bad thing.  

I've heard lots about this chocolate freeze concoction, I can't wait to go back and try it out!"
280,WhCUo8TQvjFJbW5kHeDreA,"Something about this diner is really cool. There is Southern charm, friendly staff, good portions, and a nice variety of menu items. But, it's more than that.   The people you meet here are great- many college kids. It's a perfect late night spot, and the food won't disappoint. Also great for breakfasts anytime.  I tried the Manhattan omelette- and it came with hash browns.   On top of the omelette was pastrami and french fries!  wow !
I also saw a woman get a cheese steak or some sort of sandwich that was literally the size of a football."
281,JLH_5uUwwMsODaq7Ho5enQ,"Maybe it was the hype or the majority of people who love & recommend this place are young, but it's just a diner. I grew up in a small town in the north & we would occasionally go to a couple diners for breakfast. These were true diners that looked like railroad cars. So Camellia wasn't anything special although the prices were inexpensive and a fist bump greeting by your waiter was cool. Food was just as good as a couple national chains noted for breakfast. We were told by friends comments such as ""chefs and employees put on quite a show...very entertaining and memorable."" I guess we must have missed that.

The other point which I should have read here first is it's at least a 30 minute ride, and at the moment longer, to get there from the French Quarter via streetcar. There is construction going on now and you have to get off the streetcar and take a bus which hopefully will remember you told them where you were going (ours didn't). So it was off that bus and on to another bus to get back to the Grill. Our breakfast from start to finish even though there was no line at the Grill was 2 and a half hours. At the end of the trip, we wished we had gone to the FQ location.

I still think the majority of people rating this restaurant high have never been to a diner before so the novelty is there."
282,7jTyX1HfcGk8aXhrtLryuw,"Greasy and over rated, but service was good. We went here because the ratings were so great, but save yourself and go around the block to Refuel. Went there every day of our trip and the food was fantastic each time! Grits there are amazing!!"
283,2gg0uCNncUqSlG1q4iJMSw,"It's a cattle call and I don't like to be herded. It was like a military maneuver getting a seat. With that said it is still a great place for breakfast!  Take the street car from the French Quarter and then explore Audubon Park and especially the Zoo.  Make sure you give yourself plenty of time here!

Pecan pie is HEAVEN!"
284,k_gi4EOcfuXjz-dT_zkLaQ,"The Camellia Grill is a must go if your visiting NOLA. There is only seating for about 20 around the counter so the wait can be long at times but its worth it. The food is great, I got the chili cheese omelette with home fries even though I'm not a big breakfast person it was delicious. But the best part is the friendly southern hospitality of the wait staff. 
I finished off my meal with a slice of pecan pie (do yourself a favor and try it!) that was heated on the grill and devoured the entire thing."
285,dGLdfuYzJ3j824RMZezrCw,"The best part about The Camellia Grill is that it is open late (2:00am) and the food is cheap. (Around $10)

The staff was welcoming even though they appeared to be slammed.  The section of the bar we were sitting in was sticky from someone's previous maple syrup debacle. 

I ordered a small gumbo with chicken and waffles and got the chicken and waffles first.  I was certain the gumbo would arrive shortly after my entree but it never did.  I did not get charged for the gumbo. 

I'm not disappointed by my experience. You don't go to a place like this if your looking for a classy meal.  It's open late and it's cheep, that's what you get."
286,fFgdAd6vz3d22pDUeafOzA,we had the frog burger which is according to our waiter the best thing not on the menu and it was.  This is a special creation of the cook named frog and it is amazing
287,wddho3AXcn0RG8EK2xqA_w,"Great place for breakfast! Home cooked style and they load your plate up! Breakfast for 2 only ended up costing $20 bucks total for the both of us including coffee. Can't beat that! Their omelettes are delicious! Please keep in mind that this is a diner setting and they have no tables, everyone sits at the bar top. But we didn't mind! All the staff is very friendly!"
288,nXzEuB7xC24GbHbPdrHCBA,"A cute diner where the wait staff is happy to see you and are really friendly. Food is standard diner fare that takes five minutes... great when you have kids. I love all the sights, sounds and smells-- the ambiance is a throwback to another time. What a gem for an otherwise boring weeknight. Prices are great, too. Thank you Camellia Grill."
289,PhxFhMXNV7w2R5yu5azJsA,"The food was so good and the waiter was so funny.  The only thing was portions were a bit too big.  They should open one in Chicago!!!!!!!!.
If you can try to avoid lunch time."
290,5VrlSIX-8skxTgrfr-DAuA,A charming little kitchen. I loved the waiters/cooks but the food was just ordinary. I tried the waffle with pork chop as well as the roast beef po boy. The waffle took a long time and was as thin as a pancake. The pork chop was kinda dry and plainly seasoned. The roast beef po boy has super messy (which I expected) but really not worth all the effort of eating it :/
291,cb0DGCjaVshuGyaLldrPIw,"Forgot how fluffy their omelettes are. Had a Mexican Omelette with ground beef, cheese, and topped with salsa yesterday  Yum. 

A diner across from me had a waffle and it was all I could do not to drool at the sight of it."
292,WcCBWGUi-ZMQyt3DQely2A,"This place is amazing.  Old school diner type place with awesome hash browns and omelets.  I got the chili omelet and it was absolutely 100% perfect.  I couldn't have asked for a better breakfast anywhere. If you are a breakfast fan, make sure you stop here."
293,2Y8UN-Z15bxg57GYm9QR2g,"One of my favorite places for breakfast and burgers, etc., since I was a kid. This place is an institution. I love a cheeseburger and a chocolate cherry freeze. It's the little things in life that can make us so happy."
294,vniY8I61aSXfbwrjbubW-g,"The staff is wonderful and food here is great!!! I had to get that out there first. 

I had the pecan pancakes and my girlfriend had and omelet. The pancakes were delightful as they don't short you on the pecans. The omelets are large and and the eggs are ultra light. 

We later had the pecan pie and it is all that people speak of. They put it on the grill before serving it to you, and it along with the blue bell ice cream is the best. 

P.s. You can't beat the price!!!"
295,Fqw2Pt4xSlBFpwI7_vhU_A,"Very good omelets.  Had the chef's special, but 86ed the chili.  Glad I did as they pour an entire bowl over the omelet.

All seating and service is at the counter."
296,Tw9z4EIiFr1ZjOWu7_61Ww,"Never miss this place when in NOLA.  At least once every time I go to NOLA I have breakfast at the Camilla Grill in Up Town, the food is great and the interactive service is out of this world.  You enter a stranger and leave a buddy (and stuffed too).  The gigantic omelets and hash browns are so good you can't stop eating.  My son (a student at Loyola) had the chef special; ham, bacon, turkey, cheese omelet covered in chili.  He went into a food coma at one point but worked through it.   

This is a counter style restaurant with the waiters serving you from behind the counter and having fun with you all the time.  The Camilla Grill is all about experience, a good time for all.  A must in NOLA.  Price point: 2 people $20."
297,exsfGKjBPthk721eJGWfZA,"The burgers here are so good and the service is super-friendly. It's all counter seating, and there's sometimes a line of people out into the street. They have breakfast all day."
298,1UfIjUGIIbsgewpztYqWXw,This is the perfect place for inexpensive and quick dining with very good food. Everything on the menu is very tasty and will fill you up. I really enjoy the Reuben. One of the best I've ever had.
299,hD7H0XB-sbLp5lfJCYioBQ,"They may not have the best diner food around, but its still pretty good and the atmosphere there is like nowhere else you're going to go. The staff is friendly and fun, the diner has been fixed up but still has that classic look and feel, and the food is still pretty good. You'll have to park in the Walgreens lot or on the street, and if you come on a weekend you'll probably have to wait. I live around the corner, so I never go when there's a line, but if I wasnt from around here Id probably wait the 20 minutes are so it takes to get in when its busy.

The burgers, BLT's, and omelettes are what I would recommend"
300,CX1uhdjzPWonXRQCcceLYg,"So, I feel like a bit of a jerk giving a NOLA staple like this only two stars. However, I just really can't come up with a reason to give it any more than that. We arrived at a popular lunch time and were lucky enough to be seated right away. 

Everything I've read in the reviews talks about the waiters funny banter both with customers and with each other, but we experienced none of this while we were there. The workers barely spoke to each other, and nobody seemed to even like their job. Our waiter only interacted with us to take our order and give us our food, and did the same with the people sitting next to us- no extra conversation whatsoever. We each ordered a burger and fries and they came out ok but bland, even though we ordered both of them ""dressed"". The chocolate freeze tasted like a watered down icy version of a Wendy's fast food frosty, but with less chocolate. It wasn't worth the calories. 

I'm hoping this was just a bad day for the place and that it really is the 4 star joint everyone says it is. However, for us, it was a bit of a fail."
301,poFDTpJ3IKiXysuRk4SafQ,"Love, love, love, love, love Camellia Grill!!  What's not to love - from the entertaining waiters, cozy diner atmosphere, to the deeeelicious food!  I normally order omelettes, but decided to order a burger (needed to soak up some alcohol from the night before!).  Wow - that's what a hamburger is supposed to taste like!!   And the chili cheese fries!!!   Only complaint is beans in the chili - that's a no no for a Texas girl!"
302,Rw5_zqB7uJEF741cT9pSuw,"Awesome breakfast! Wiith great personalities. We ordered the chilli cheese omelet; our friends ordered the manhattan and cheese omelettes. For dessert... of course the Pecan pie. Will was our server but Marvin who has there for 26+ years entertained us and the rest of the restaurant Go hungry, but leave happy and more than satisfied!"
303,eetMSLiMRQa98zmuFbIF-Q,"Stopped in for a couple beers. Cool sports bar atmosphere. Huge selection of beers, both in tap and in bottles. Bartender was friendly and helpful. Would definitely go back!"
304,nXJmnTsAARjX4bVzFdoCDQ,Absolutely need to visit this cute little diner. Wait staff was very polite and personable. Our food was delicious and simple.  My two young ones were very pleased with the experience :)
305,148bM48N0eonEvL-Tiz4oA,"Not the greatest but then again it's a true diner so dont expect high end cuisine here.  I recommend the burgers, waffles, omelets, milkshakes and PIE! great place for the late night ""cravings"" always some characters in there and the servers are fun"
306,yGmqPleGsC1uBxmhd1QKug,"The chocolate pecan pie a la mode was mind blowing. I ordered it unsuspectingly, just expecting a run-of-the-mill slice of pie, and then I looked up and saw the guy at the counter covering a portion of the grill with butter and heating up the pie. It got all caramelized and amazing. I'm sure other things on the menu are good too....but damn, that pie."
307,nI448jVKK3EUGILDG5HXwg,Very good great service and very fast and it is small but I went on a good day there was plenty of seats . Onion rings and burgers and the chili cheese omelette were amazing !!!
308,egIDu60S77IiFTXuT0_99Q,First time here and I must say the burger was delicious! Made to order and juicy! Very cozy place and waiters are awesome and friendly! Must try'
309,ifQALGqovLrXyl82O-1FRQ,"Do you like apples?

 I had a slice of apple pie a la mode and my girlfriend had the chocolate pecan pie a la mode.  

I am a huge apple pie fan, and theirs is great, but I would have to recommend the pecan pie over the apple.  Delish.

But wait, there's more.  

They don't just cut you a piece and hand it over, nor do they rely on keeping it warm, and microwaves aren't involved either.

They grill your pie!  On the same griddle that cooks the burgers and grilled onions.  Holy balls.   I can see how this might upset some of you (not a vegetarian treat).  It's amazing. It comes to you hot and crispy with a slight hint of meaty smokiness.  WOW.  If you're the type who likes to let the syrup get on your bacon and sausage, then this is right up your alley.  If you don't like mixing sweet with salty...get over it.  This is mostly sweet and you'll love it.

The friendly staff will chat you up and give you a fist bump across the counter (no tables in here, counter seating only).  

I haven't tried the lunch or dinner fare from this place, but the pies....oh boy.  5 star rating for the pie. 

Decent prices overall, and a great experience."
310,G5wJgZIpVzgXogkXC44M4g,"People love this place but I wasn't that impressed. Staff wasn't that friendly, one employee spent our entire visit taking on her cellphone, and to top it off, we watched a roach crawl across the counter while we ate. The pecan waffle was good but I had to stop eating when I poured some syrup and a fly was floating in it. My companion enjoyed her omelette but the bugs were too much for us."
311,ghg_NWaq2oWeFVxsM-w9lQ,"Camellia's is the best place in New Orleans for a bite of greasy spoon food. I love  to go here on a Sunday morning and getting an order of cheese fries, burger (dressed of course), with a freeze.  

The host, waiters, and cashier are all friendly and extremely welcoming. If you are from out of town and looking for an quick bite, hop off of the streetcar at Riverbend and visits Camellia's."
312,U9R3PVpltYbndkybWcEADg,"Our last stop before we headed home, and probably my favorite restaurant we are on the whole trip! We took the trolley from our hotel to the restaurant which was a $1 per person and takes you straight to the restaurant which was awesome! 

They only have bar seating, which I'm not used to but had no problem with. Reminded of and older upscale Waffle House on the inside! The staff was so nice and entertaining. I ordered the spinach, egg white, onion, and cheese omelette with hash browns and coffee and my stomach was so happy after I was finished. My boyfriend ordered the pancakes, and Oh my goodness they were fantastic! I definitely cannot waiting to come back to this cute little diner, it was great!"
313,baLpQ19vBc45vZKDe8dbbw,"A great Diner dinning experience. It's a no frills, no non-sense no time for food pics kind of place. You get in, sit on a couch and wait for someone to seat you. You climb on a 50's style bar stool and sit up against a single counter top that curves around this small but nostalgic diner. Love the Mickey clock on the wall!  Menus are laid out in front of you with corresponding order sheets for the waiter to check off your order (don't touch it!). The menu is basic but exactly what you need for a breakfast place. We ordered pancakes with three bacon,  a waffle with three bacon, a bacon omelette and mushroom omelette. The waiter calls off the order to the quick order chefs five feet away reminiscent of the famous Philly cheese-steak joints.  Within 5 minutes our first order came out and in 10 minutes all four dishes was out and served. That quick! The omelettes were crazy good. Don't let the look deceive you. The pancakes and waffles were of average size and fluffy-enough. Perfect size for kids or a side order for hungry adults. In 20 minutes we were done and out! They ask if you are leaving a cash tip to leave it on the counter with your server.  Had to run 9 miles to work it off but will definitely be back!"
314,9upuY_bo3NgPEPbi_gQ2_g,"Waffles and chicken, pecan pie. An institution! And in a BEEEAAUUUTIFUL section of the city."
315,GLeIQxT6zehvp9CcTZhXMA,"A must go to spot, the burgers are unbelievable!!! The service, oh the service!! We had this guy Leon who was the best personality I've ever seen in a restaurant. My friend had the Roast Beef Sandwich which he said was super tender and delicious."
316,HIkC9A0lzrgH1lmaigtHpw,"Visited from California , got off the trolley and found this Gem .
Great food and service , Rubens is awesome with a side of fries ..  And the the hick burger and adding bacon gives it a great taste . definitely coming back when I am in town ....."
317,-q2Cq-J9acflRvpUFNlTcg,"Great diner food! Freezes are excellent. Cheap quality food. Like waho only better because they have french fries. Really friendly service, less friendly host but whatever."
318,7cNKcfvAGUdyQhatmP1njw,"Fantastic vibe, great service. The food is classic diner food, but distinctively New Orleans.  My buddies and I show up here at least twice a month and gorge away the hangovers."
319,X78o-zten8IRzfJ4GqGSeA,"Although convenient to the streetcar, Camellia Grill is definitely worth hiking a couple miles for, as I often did as a freshman without wheels and as my girlfriend and I recently did all the way from the campus of Tulane University after having already hoofed several miles to work up an appetite. Known more for omelettes that have satisfied frat houses full of severely hungover Tulane students, we diversified at this late lunch hour to share a cup of gumbo and fried catfish po-boy, being the first Friday of Lent and all. I appreciated the warm welcome and parting fist-bump from the friendly waiter. Fueled up for the return stroll back to Audubon, I was reminded how much I heart Camellia Grill as a tasty and affordable uptown institution. Go Green Wave."
320,cOP-KCozlE13yQ4ScBP-Og,"I ate the best breakfast I've had in years at the Camellia Grill this past Wednesday morning.  All this place is is a diner; but, it is the quintessential diner.  Eggs, sausage, hash browns, toast and coffee seem to be a simple thing.  Most places don't do it all that well.  This place does.

Even better there's a show while you wait and then order and then eat.  The day and the shift we were there, Leon was the server and the entertainer.  I posted a picture of him, it's no. 101 or 102.

Go to the Camellia Grill, you won't regret it."
321,vHNK6zx1dE5aqEW78sKJ1A,"Worth the wait if there is a line...but this is one of my favorite places to eat in New Orleans. Everything on the menu is delicious, especially the burgers. Breakfast food is also amazing. Atmosphere is fun."
322,1zeG2wSc82NjAM6tFmm__A,"People are seriously blinded by the history of the place.

The service is terrible, they always forget something in your order, and the food isn't that good. Don't waste your time."
323,k_gF2crZuHrmYy092NoXpg,"Sure it's touristy but there's a reason for it. The food is greasy, big and simple. You're bound to get a laugh with the wait staff as at least one of them has the energy for everyone behind the counter.

The waffles here are thin and crispy. The bacon is nothing special but it'll give you the salt fix you've been hankerin' fer.

I still sometimes wince to see allllll the white people on one side of the counter and allllll the black people on the other.

But... that's the way it goes. Everyone gets along because they depend on one another."
324,Z7Z-hFdEsi5gT8FQEH41gg,"i'm surprised there's only been 49 reviews of this place!

This place is a New Orleans must-have if you want an authentic experience.  Open since 1946 (I asked), ths NOLA landmark was closed down for many years following Katrina and only reopened not too long ago.

Not much has changed since 1946, and their omlettes are more addicting than ever (I'm pretty sure they sprinkle crack in it to make it so good).  The eggs are lighter than anything you'll ever have (they told me the secret is a malt blender, btw).  Top the omlette w/ chili and cheese, you have yourself a food orgasm (and a small heart attack).  

If you want FULL heart attack, try their Chef's Special Omlette ($8)..pretty much the same as the chili omlette, but with bacon and fries inside it.  

If you have room for dessert (probably not possible) -- do try their pecan waffle.  They should call it waffle pecan, cuz really its more nut than batter.

I will miss this place when I leave NOLA after my project is over!!"
325,S3KEmKbVVekNKAtZUYEaIA,"I grew up on the coast hearing all the stories about Camillia and decided to finally venture there this week. Since I was told that Carrolton was all torn up I came in the backway via River Road. Parking was not difficult but as usual the New Orleans electronic parking meters were out of wack.
We stopped at lunchtime and didnt have too long of a wait but the hostess didnt seem to enjoy her job. We were seated after a row had cleared and the busser was no were to be found, our waiter had to finally clear the counter. Our waiter Ray I believe was courteous and attentive but nothing like all the stories we had heard about the waiters there, guess alot of the old timers have passed on or retired.
My partner ordered the New York Strip with salad and fries and I was in the mood for one of their cheeseburgers. The food was basically greasy diner food nothing special, my burger was good but not great. I think that Camillia is best known for breakfast.
One thing that we noticed is that the waiter calls out everyones order to the cook who is always busy at the grill, a gentleman next to us mentioned that they never get anything wrong. What the man seated next to us did not  know at the time was that his order would be forgotten. Since the man was leaving to catch a flight he cancelled but the cook who was upset that he didnt get his order whipped him up a sandwich in no time and our waiter chased him down the street with the freshly made sandwich free of charge. Rare that a restaurant takes care of their mistakes and Camellia certainly gets a compliment on their handling of this one. 
While Camellia did not live up to my expectations it certainly is the place to stop after an evening of partying in the Quarter to to ease your pain. 
Note: the place was very filthy, they need to spend a few down days cleaning that place up!"
326,OyXxhy3PG6OOm5mZvKXgig,"This is the type of place you give 10 stars to! I lllllllllllllllllooooooooooooovvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeeee the chocolate pecan pie! OMG!!! 

BTW: EVERYTHING ELSE IS AMAZING AS WELL!! XOXO"
327,Zf4INi63kKQv_f5Igym7-A,"Taking the streetcar down St. Charles on a beautiful spring day and looking at all the beautiful Victorian homes is a treat in itself.  It was the start of a great day.

We arrived at Camillia Grill at noon.  We got inside and waited 20 minutes for our counter seats.  We were will entertained by Marvin, our waiter entertained us during our visit.

We loved the low key, diner food.  We ordered the Ruben Special, Camillia Muffuletta and roast beef with mushroom sandwich.  We loved the taste of each of these sandwiches.  We shared a taste of all three sandwiches.  Our real tasty treat was the chocolate freeze.  That's a must.

Worth the time and effort to get this local diner."
328,WGJxOB2QKc1TWok8dbWrTA,Perfect cure for the blues or a hangover.  Breakfast of champs was burger w/ fried egg and bacon and a side of chili fries.  Food came quickly and with a smile from our Waiter Chris who was a real gem.
329,lfDwdj_C9vmclYL-qVoqVw,"If you don't mind a wait this is the place for breakfast food.  Delicious omelets and milkshakes!  Small and elbow to elbow, but the cooks make you feel right at home.  Definitely worth the wait!"
330,wuGJFVvoEwWr7Am0sP6rpw,"Disclaimer: If you're looking for upscale, classy, super clean eatery...this is NOT for you. Location: You can't beat the location because this area is polluted with eaters, salons, bars, shops etc. The staff members are good people but they just need a tip here and there to make this place better for the naysayers. Camellia's has this old school diner feel to it but with a modern or urban twist. The food is as advertised IMO. I can't do it review justice with words so try it for yourself. Don't get me wrong, this isn't the best food (its good to me though) its just hard for me to describe. Will I be back?? Of course"
331,ENm2IhmiTusvA5gS_Ykfmg,"Counter seating only, but that offers the best view.  We enjoyed a mushroom and Swiss omelette, a Mexican omelette, very spicy and a good old-fashioned American two eggs ham and toast. The homemade hash browns perfect and crispy.
The staff are very efficient and friendly and we saw two excellent short order cooks that run that kitchen expertly."
332,uh1OKPP2dePE62WTwYNQqQ,"We came to Camellia Grill for lunch. We ordered muffeletta and crispy waffle. The waiters are friendly and attentive. The food came very quickly after we ordered it. The restaurant setting is an old-fashioned bar style. We are able to meet the locals and tourists who are sitting next to us - which is a very cool experience. Moreover, the waiter asked everyone to stand up and greet my friend who came from Hong Kong at the ""Camellia"" way. That was excellent.

I highly recommend to go to this restaurant when anyone visits New Orleans."
333,OVoL9JEzZ2UkMgC_b3_rew,I thought I reviewed this place last year. Phenomenal!!!!! I'm going back to NOLA tomorrow and can't wait to get the bacon cheese omelet !!
334,jX_REh2-0uw6T1n9aa2vgQ,"My friend and I were in town for a concert and we had a local friend take us here. We had just driven 3 hours and had a really rough time at the concert and we were starving and in need of nice food/people. Brun, our server, was so incredibly friendly and took such good care of us and the food was so comforting and amazing and exactly what we needed after the day we had. I am so grateful and I truly cannot wait to come back next time I'm in town. But seriously, Brun was great."
335,v52PbLGg5SZ0ZgpH9DJRLQ,A must eat place. Pecan pie makes non pie eaters into pecan pie lovers. Catfish was tender & crispy and not greasy. Service is jovial and puts anyone in a good mood.
336,RUR9i79E398jgbwBCCjw0w,"This is Don from Ohio. I was told at my hotel to go here. Took the trolley to the end of the track. People treated me like I was family. IT WAS EVERYTHING THE LADY TOLD ME IT WAS GOING TO BE. Great place , please visit. 
Thank you, Don"
337,csxxp29mt3Z2cy6UORJm7g,"Had breakfast here with the wife today.  She had pecan pancakes, I had a sausage omelette.  Nothing fancy, very plain, and unimaginative food; nothing that was really ""southern"" style.  The only thing I can say is that the service and vibe was fun and it was reasonably priced."
338,VH2ER5POqxL8PT0QFwQP6Q,"Small place, diner seating, you want to know where the locals eat you found it. I had the deep fried catfish po-boy and am a better person for it."
339,b_NX8vy5eVn8cxtZuWW3hA,"Okay, so I have really mixed feelings about the Camellia Grill. 
I'm from the northeast of Florida and grew up on the Florida/Alabama border, so I am quite accustomed to southern comfort food. So I was really excited to try this restaurant when my boyfriend and I heard about it on our vacation. 
We found free parking in the pharmacy just 2 doors down and found the restaurant incredibly easy to get to. We had read about the communal bar seating before we went and therefore were prepared for a bit of an experience with the close quarters and jovial waiters.
But honestly, what we ended up getting was just a blur of upsetting experiences and incredible food.
When we got there the place was absolutely packed and we sat waiting for a good half hour before being seated, which we didn't mind. However, when we finally were seated a man came by and forced us to get up and wait longer so a woman and her son could eat instead even though they hadn't been there as long as we had and we had already settled in. Who does that?
Pretty upset at this point at being strangely uprooted we waited another 10-15 minutes as other patrons told the employees that it was our turn to eat and questioning why we had been moved. Finally, we were seated again and allowed to order.
By the way, they really aren't kidding when they say that the seating is close knit. I could have easily eaten off my neighbors plate or even stuck my arm in it if I wasn't careful. My legs were pushed against several strangers and there was no way to move them.
But aside from all of that, my boyfriend and I had come there to eat and have a good time so we got plenty of food and tried to keep our spirits up.
I got a corned beef omelette with a side of grits and a chocolate cherry milkshake while my boyfriend got a cheeseburger and macaroni and cheese bites. 
We waited an incredibly long time for our food, in which the waiters joked with the customers but refused to acknowledge we existed. 
When our food finally arrived we were so shocked at just how good it was. I love corned beef and this was seriously blissful. Not to mention the chocolate cherry milkshake was indulgent.
However, my grits and my boyfriend's macaroni bites just never appeared. And we couldn't get a waiter to stop long enough to tell them. Even when other patrons attempted to help us.
Finally as we had nearly finished our main courses we were able to find a waiter who told us they had forgotten we had even ordered our sides and finally got them for us. He then proceeded to yell at the entire restaurant about all the things you could do with grits while we attempted to eat them hurriedly.

Overall, the food was outstanding and if I could take advantage of their to go option I'd never stop. 
However, the service was a joke and I felt completely invisible from the time I came in until I left. Which isn't great for the prices they charge."
340,izwzjVchGeJl4QaTz1cF7Q,"Energy Amazing!!! Great food and even better service!! As soon as u walk in a ""Hey Baby How You Doin"" is definitely gonna happen HA!!!! Loved it!!! Fire food and Fire service"
341,zRe_TTuRgY5pbMFZdkuVuA,"Visiting the French Quarters but want to get out to see New Orleans? Take the St. Charles Street Car Line to where it makes a right turn on S. Carrollton Ave and stop at Camellia Grill for an afternoon of sightseeing and southern hospitality. Camellia Grill is NOLA hospitality at its finest. A fun place to enjoy a burger, chili  cheese fries and a piece of their pecan pie.

This is where the locals eat! While the good is very good, it is the staff that makes this place - it is just a down right fun place to be. All you need to do is sit down at the counter for a few minutes to realize that most of the folks are return customers. They countermen enjoy a rapport with the customer - they joke and laugh together. Yet, even though I was a new comer I did not feel left out.

Go and enjoy a great afternoon."
342,Bw14jVR-LjSNv1dI7hUEJA,Amazing.  Not only the food but the ambiance (old south).  Get an omelette and a freeze
343,VPi4Z5AXIyrEZQpKLbdVGw,Everyone should  come here at least once for the experience.  It's a NOLA treat. My fav is the chocolate freeze!! The service is great and entertaining.
344,BC9kdIIHOpUMB5reG4GXEw,"Not what it used to be but then these days what is?! I was there one morning mid-week, arriving at 8am. It's supposed to open at 8am but they were slow and kept everyone outside waiting until 8:15. Some people left and bumped us up to 1st in line but that didn't help. The grits were runny, the bacon was greasy and not crisp. I asked for crisp but didn't return it because I waited too long for all of our food to arrive. The food all arrived in its own time. I was served eggs and grits then a few minutes later the toast came and even later was the bacon, my companions were served much later, even though we all ordered at the same time. Oh well, there are lots of other breakfast places."
345,DKw1SlS5xue5xCi-7StapA,"Pecan Pie a la mode.  Is one of my fondest memories from the time I spent in New Orleans as a student over 25 years ago.  At that time Camellia Grill was a New Orleans Classic and it still is today.  I have always looked for that pie experience since that time.  Nothing can quite match that pie being heated on the flat top and then served with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Unfortunately, my short recent trip to New Orleans didn't allow time for me to sit and have a meal.  But, my friends were able to get me there to pick up a pecan pie to go. It was a little less than $20 for the whole pie. Yes I ate a slice at the airport prior to departure.  But, I carried the rest of that pie like a newborn all the way back to L.A.  It will be shared with my friends after I heat it up and with a nice scoop of vanilla on top.  The pie itself has a dense almost brittle like topping of pecans, the filling was not cloying like the many versions but had a touch of custardy sweetness and the crust crispy.  

The overall experience is unique.  Yes only counter seating.  Yes there may be a wait.  Yes there may be many tourists.  But, look at the reviews from New Orleans and nearby residents.  This is a local classic.  Whenever in New Orleans, Camellia Grill is always on a list of to do.  Your opinion may very but most people think it is great.  Thanks for the awesome pie.  I will stop in again when I can.  Don't you change."
346,eF9cKFIwROsmyi1Wz8PeQQ,"Holy moly!!!

Chef omelet I believe it was called. A giant omelet covered in chilli. HECK YEAH!!!!!

Cons....I didn't get to sit with my party and had to eat alone while they dined in another corner without me because space is limited. 

Idk if I particularly liked the waiter calling me beautiful every 5 seconds and constantly commenting on getting tips. Even worse than feeling harassed, was the fact that the compliments were so disingenuine. Every chick with a wallet was repeated the same line and all of a sudden became the center of attention when it was time to shell out.

Anyway. The price was great, the food was delicious and plentiful. Check it out :)"
347,QA_osK1SVj5yvm6e2M5y0w,"Skip the onion rings, get chili cheese fries with your burger. The turkey club is amazing. Try the breakfast too!"
348,o9z2RgzADxPkEcDo4C2fsg,"I live in California, and all I can think about is how can I get my boss to pay for a business trip to go back to eat the omelets at Camellia Grill.  Their food is sooooo good!

I'll give you the reason why their omelet is sooo good...they use a milkshake mixer to whip the eggs!  The eggs get sooooo fluffy.  It's like biting into an egg pancake.  

Enough said!  Just go and eat!"
349,BDqQEUf19tZxhj_hvTQWfw,"The Camellia Grill is a steadfast dependable friend. The food is always excellent, the price is quite afforable, the service is quick and friendly, and the calm diner ambience is so special and unique. 

My Mother always took me here when we were in New Orleans, and her parents always took her her when they were in town. Today I took my boyfriend here and the tradition continues! The Camellia Grill is legendary, classsic and always delivers the goods.

Today my boyfriend loved is Catfish Po' boy and I loved my mexican omelette. Thank you, Camellia Grill!"
350,47HFrEVw8xXxdmJFQFgS6g,The Camillia Grill is a landmark restaurant for comfort food and I was not disappointed. A local friend brought me in and the dining experience took me back to the drug store grill days. The Mickey Mouse clock from the early 1940's is a symbol of my parent's time that I cherish. I'll be back again when I visit!
351,AgYFDF6IfpUjWNxWBVgocA,"Around 15 years ago, I paid my first visit to The Camellia Grill. I sat down on the right hand side in the corner bar stool, and Marvin the waiter approached me, held out his fist straight to me. It was my first fist bump ever.

Over the years I've patronized Camellia many times when I'm visiting New Orleans from Nashville. Today wasn't any different, and Marvin is still there entertaining us.

Get the chili cheese omelet and a slice of apple pie a la mode for dessert. You won't go wrong."
352,KaNuR0DT7gpNledD25hyQw,"If you want a greasy burger and fries, this is definitely the place. The quality of the hamburger was just average hell you could get the same at at Wendy's to be quite honest, and without sitting in the lap of other patrons! the counter-top seating is not comfortable but I guess when you're ushering people in&out you don't wanna make it a place to relax. Between the people poking you in the back as they leave and the elbow of the guy sitting next to you in your side this place is nothing special.. I value my personal space when I'm eating. Nothing worse than somebody breathing all over your food, and its not you!"
353,U1MGChEiUrct_mzTJ34wSg,A favorite for visitors & locals alike. No place like it in the city! Friendly staff & wonderful service always! Yummy too!
354,mp8J-QzjTLOXfGD-aqI57w,"Service was slow and kind of rude. There was no alcoholic beverages as advertised. Not very impressed. Food was decent for breakfast food, then again hard to mess up. Overall not my greatest time eating breakfast."
355,TOMaE8EnNsbenxw5miG2XQ,The guys behind the counter make the place-especially Marvin. I have a secret crush on him! Gave us complimentary chocolate freezes when we ordered. I had the club and cheese fries. Great diner food. Old school feel. They take care of you there!
356,4LFLAtHJr3yfH9j8trSMFA,"The guys who work here are so nice! Everyone was kind and talkative. The food was gross, but it was so funny bc they had a big grease fire going on for a little while. Overall we had a good experience with the employees but the food just isn't very good."
357,8YdSaJ9Sg_USC8hlSQ9o7Q,"Let me start by saying that I visited this establishment because they got voted one of the best places for breakfast and pecan pie. Welp, I was HIGHLY disappointed when I recieved my omelette and pie. Whoever voted this place to be one of the best has never had real food. I have had better food at Denny's. It didnt help that the hostess was anoyed with our presence. She yelled at us to go to the counter seats that had opened up. Can you believe that? What happened to walking over  speaking respectfully to your visitors? Southern hospitality? NOT! Then, when we got ready to leave we did not leave the tip on the counter, we left it on the card. Our waiter must not get too many card tips because we could hear him talking garbage about us not leaving cash. Ignorance at maximum level at this joint. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the outdated, old school, run down look of the establishment but thats about it. Needless to say, I would NOT return to this place and definitely will spread the word about the horrible service."
358,i1j01Ywqn3eAm5nQzafw2w,i work in the quarter and am so happy for  Camellia on chartres and toulouse!  Sneak off for lunch at least once a week.  the omelets are divine and the staff is always friendly and damn good at their jobs :-)
359,i7muo2Nzt7JYJlrhu2D8NQ,"I was just looking for a quick bite to eat before I got on the road and was pleasantly surprised by this little treat. Leon is hilarious and makes the dining experience enjoyable. My cheeseburger was cooked to perfection. I got hash browns and they were yummy! My son said his veggie omelette was delicious. Our waiter even slipped me a taste of chocolate freeze because he had made a little too much. Better than a Wendy's frosty. 
I will definitely be back when I'm in New Orleans."
360,NHTrubFVEYRe-OPzZu7J0g,"Like most restaurants known as ""institutions"" the experience tends to get a little tainted by the high expectations you carry going in. This place is definitely high on personality. Old school counter style diner. But foodwise there are a bunch of other places I'd rather go. Burgers and the pecan waffles were pretty so-so to me."
361,Fvqf-Upau7QzX2PB3r6lrA,Nothing spectacular.....save your money... Plus the food has way too much oil.... If you want clogged arteries and bad customer service then go for it. If not go somewhere else. Had to ask for coffee 4x before I got it and etc.....
362,BU4rhvAEDIIU88Vtkt6CaA,"Camelia is one of my favorites, but objectively the food is not why people love to come. The atmosphere is diner style, with straight-to-the-counter service. The biggest perk is the late hours, and let me promise that a Camelia grill Muffuletta eaten drunk at 11pm tastes just as good as anywhere else in the city."
363,lKI7MsWrus0KOMOTFosWqw,"We stumbled on to this place while looking for breakfast. What a great deal!  This is the best breakfast food ever. The staff is prompt, the food is fast, the price is great! They cook it right in front of  you too, you can see the whole process so no worries about sanitation!  We went there the rest of our stay for breakfast."
364,H_ooXLaG8IXDmhNRRPngrg,Great food and service. You could be happily surprised at just what might happen during your visit. Make sure you're awake!
365,xnddwY5S0Y-abjBMWzKpnQ,"The place was packed.....
felt like an old time diner (50s) so that was cool.  It was noisy (I suppose cause of the acoustics, or lack thereof).  We popped in to grab a bite and the line was out the door.  The location we visited was the one at the end of the trolley line.  The food was basic americana, but smelled and tasted great.
Def. would visit again.  Wouldn't go to the one in the French Quarter, esp on a busy holiday as it's packed and you have to fight through too many crowds."
366,JdE31k3QFDhAjarxj6woKw,"Loved this place! Cool, old-fashioned dinner with yummy greasy food. You order by checking off things on a piece of paper. But the best part is when we ordered dessert, the waiter guy threw our piece of pecan pie on the grill to warm it up. And then, after a few minutes, flipped it. Wow that pie was good."
367,x8coAV-ymTFX6TO_lYWC9g,"Very cool place. No frills breakfast food. Coffee, eggs, waffles maybe. No alcohol - this isn't a brunch place, it's a diner. 

Very friendly staff and a cool history from what I understand. Only about 20 seats in the place- I bet it gets insane on weekend mornings."
368,8g4a4lU14OSqYUwbtR0JOQ,This is a cozy little diner where the locals eat. It's nothing fancy but the service is great. The food is even better!  We tried the omelet and the double burger patty with melted cheese with a side of chili and Cole slaw. (I can't recall the name of this plate). The portions are generous as well. Another bonus is that you can take the streetcar to this location. What a treat!
369,nWHEmxWOH8vdd7T5C4mllg,This place was a true jewel after a night of drinking. I wish the place was bigger though. The line was long and hanging outside of the dinner so we just opted out to get our food to go and seat in our car and eat. I wish I had taken a picture of my food but literally it was gone within 5 mins. I got the bacon cheese burger and added an egg on top of the burger. Best burger I've had hands down. The pecan pie look amazing as well but I didn't want to over do it. Next time though.
370,eewb5y0nVPkPaJ2Qcm3wjQ,"WOW, I didn't know I like Pecan Pie that much until I eat it here. 

I came here on Sunday night around 11PM, there were no line, so I got a seat right away. I ordered Pecan Waffle and Pecan pie with ice cream. 

It was my last meal of the day and probably the most memorable ones too, OMG, it was delicious!!!

I would drive to NOLA just to eat here."
371,SpewseNg68sVp3ESGXj64A,"Small quaint place, depending on time you visit there could be a line.  I went for breakfast and had the pecan pancakes. Great pancake batter. Bacon wasn't great but tasted ok. They do have turkey bacon which I wished I had known so I would have ordered that instead. Pretty quick service."
372,2hqGbp0UfgxfI_HI5Dj09g,"This is absolutely a MUST when traveling to New Orleans. You can take the trolley right to it. You will most likely have to wait, but the food and staff are excellent. Takes you back in time. I was ecstatic when I heard it opened back up after Katrina."
373,d45NITC2VadIxhqCOzMyVA,"second time here. about 2 years apart. seems like new management. the logos on the cups are different, and the food isn't as good. the service is still attentive and polite. the staff performs right in front of you and the place is clean. probably not going back. just a bit disappointed."
374,1Ok2pOEpCbKhCu9TJF-jyQ,It don't get better than this. This food is out of this world tasty. I had the chefs omelette smothered in chili.  I ate every bite.  I then topped it off sharing a plate of pecan pancakes.  Let's just say that I think these are the best pancakes in the world.  The long line is with the wait.   Don't let that deter you.  Highly recommend this place for a real taste of the south.
375,BU5Sn_GH0F_CtWXV0ciRMw,"OMG! We went for the pecan pie. It was grilled in butter on the grill to heat it up, slathered with chocolate sauce and served with ice cream. An amazing dessert! Our server, Brun, was fun, informative and took great care of us. You just can't go wrong. I'm just sorry that we didn't have room for one of their famous burgers."
376,UluBrh238OVLH8X5SnX7IQ,"A New Orleans staple! Camellia Grill doesn't seem like anything too special, but it's the only place like it still left. You really get such an old fashion diner experience. Not to mention- the food is absolutely amazing. The bacon cheese burger is my go-to. Perfect cure to a hangover or when you just want to pig out. Definitely not the place to go when you're trying to loose some weight!"
377,kR28I_muoQGwF4cO94Fwdw,"So much to say about Camellia Grill. It may seem like just an old, run-down restaurant, but it is much more than that. Camellia puts out great breakfast food that I will eat at any time of the day, very good burgers and sandwiches, and excellent desserts like their pecan pie. I recommend the Manhattan and Chef Special Omelettes for breakfast and the Club Sandwich.

 The food is half the reason you go there. The other half is just for the atmosphere. It has that old fashioned diner feel, and the wait staff is great, nice, and very entertaining.

Whether you are really hungover or just looking for a great meal, you really can't go wrong going to Camellia."
378,o9t2WyZCJnbpEfb6NVLp0g,"Visited Camellia's Grill while in New Orleans for a work conference. We stayed in Loyola University's dorms and asked the RA for a dinner recommendation. She raved about how wonderful Camellia's Grill was and insisted that we go there. Ehhhh, I won't be listening to her anymore! The food wasn't terrible but definitely wasn't as good as she claimed. It's a small, intimate diner with the cooks right in front of you. There's nothing to hide in this little nook. There won't be any dropping of ingredients on the floor and using them. 

Since I'm a vegetarian, about the only thing on their menu I could eat was a veggie omelet. Not really what I was in the mood for but it had to do. Nothing to write home about but it filled my empty stomach. Not a place I'll be revisiting."
379,MH1T2l9G68nJhAyOAkjMjA,"The food was DEFINITELY worth the wait! Even though we had to wait 30mins, the food was AMAZING! The best chocolate milk I ever had in my life and best waffles. I ate the whole waffle which I never do! Would definitely go again for a good brunch!"
380,Fuo2Ig9VetBjyaFSOqHWww,This is by far the best New Orleans diner. It is aneé Orleans institution open for generations of locals and tourists alike. Open late and a classic nola thing to do. I try to go back every time I geaux home.
381,TEYLBEbRnLXpVZlIX_8p0A,"Love the people working there. They represent the best of this city. They are kind and do a great job. The food is ample and wholesome.  Once you wait in a long line, and believe me its a miracle to not have to wait here, you will not wait long for your good food.  I love the chile omelet and banana cream pie. Why wouldn't I right?  Next time I may try something else but I like to stick with winners!! Take the trolley down there and remember ""exact change""!!"
382,fDf2Bdka72XT-GXfqBQJvA,"I'm down with diners for breakfast, and fully expected a typical diner experience here, but this place didn't even rise to those standards. We definitely had the wrong server because I saw other guests getting much better service so this could possibly have been a better experience. We had to keep asking for our first cup of coffee, had to ask for utensils after our food arrived. But the kitchen would still have been a cluttered, filthy mess, my waffle would still have been literally flat and rubbery, bacon would still have also been rubber, and burnt at the same time, the butter would still have been a golden, lukewarm liquid (I Do Believe it's Not Butter) you pour out of a syrup bottle and the maple syrup would still have been pancake syrup, although I asked my waiter if it was real maple syrup or pancake syrup, to which he replied ""Oh, it's the REEEAL maple syrup"". Not that I expected real maple syrup, I just always ask - if it's not I'll order something else, no biggie. My husband said his omelette, made with the same rubbery, burnt bacon, was gross. The coffee is typical diner coffee, which is probably the best thing I can say about this place."
383,DppOr-KTR-73BOEqpHbQrw,"Whenever given the choice of sitting at the counter or sitting at a regular table...seriously this is a no contest.  Always go for the counter.  At Camellia, you are always in the right, there is only a counter.  A long counter that zags out in two places.  Not as zaggy as the counter at the Grand Central Oyster Bar's, but pleasantly so.

It's a diner and the food is good.  Diner good.  You'll get the full diner experience here (go on off hours, unless you want to wait).  I suggest going all in for breakfast with at least a waffle or pancakes...or go the sandwich route.  Reuben, Chopped Beef, Grilled Cheese.  Whichever way, you're going to be golden.

Oh, and I suggest making an excursion to the restroom.  It's worth the adventure."
384,3V8ll5Ae0eoqK6DnlYG4Sw,So nice actually  sang happy birthday in a very New Orleans way.....staff is amazing.  Stumbled upon this place by chance.  Would return again and again!!!
385,GwZZMfVKsgAxzGw1nj6oeA,Worth the wait if you have never been here. Long Nawlins tradition with terrific servers. Big plates at reasonable prices. Go see what local living is about.
386,DHCK09hw7Gu9pJLzlCDnJg,"This is really two reviews, one for the sober crowd, one for the lit.

Sober folk - you should know better. Grease is the dominant flavor in everything including the pies, the place is filthy despite being rehabbed about 8 minutes ago, and you WILL get sick from what you ate. 1 star. 

Tipsy people - this place gets 4 stars - cheap greasy food that plays well with whatever you've been pickling yourself with. Does it taste good? Who cares! You're drunk! Chances are the alcohol will kill most of the bugs in your burger."
387,1dG3Hlm_4fIufpsegDVVzQ,"Camellia Grill is a 70 year-old classy short-order diner, famous for its sandwiches, breakfast all day, pies and ""freezes.""

Hurricane Katrina closed down this staple of the Uptown-Riverbend neighborhood. Luckily, its persuasive fan base (evidenced by the number of internet postings referring to the place, its wikipedia page, and the copious amounts of love letters left by patrons begging the grill to re-open) got it going again after Katrina. Power to the people! Camellia Grill was re-established in April 2007.

Two friends and I ate brunch here in November 2008. We waited in line about 30 minutes out front on a Saturday around noon, making conversation with other hungry New Orleanians in line who recommended the same dishes we had seen our foodie friends around town drool about. We sat on spinning stools in a curved bar formation made of marble waited on by friendly, efficient, bow-tie wearing waiters. They brought cloth napkins and marked off our individual orders onto a pre-printed worksheet with a red pen. They then fetched coffee and blended up the creamy cool chocolate freeze drinks while yelling the orders to the cooks to fry up the tastiest omelettes and burgers around.

We tried the Pecan Waffle, which came plain on a plate with three mini pitchers on the side filled with Cane Syrup, Maple-Flavored Corn Syrup and Liquid Butter. It was perfectly cooked, crunchy and warm all the way through. I liked that they skipped the dollop of butter or whipped cream that waffle houses usually plop on top- saving both the restaurant and patron time, money and extra Calories.

We also tried the Chef's Special Omelette: a monstrous one with potatoes and onions inside, topped with a lot of chili (with turkey bacon, beans, ham and beef) and two types of cheese, with french fries on the side. That was tasty! Enough said!

The Chocolate Freeze Drink (a chocolate frappe with chopped ice) was sweet and delicious, reminding me of thick chocolate milk with crushed ice in it.

After eating, we took our individual forms and paid at the cash register by the door  (by cash or credit card), again saving the waiters and patrons time. This place knows how to do it. The only problem with Camellia Grill is that we didn't allow our food to settle. That was it though, everything was delicious and pleasant.   

See my post on the fresh dish dot com for accompanying photos and a recipe for the chefs special omelette."
388,eQ7uiuhcDpKFPPf_p2KHmQ,"Still craving for this breakfast again. The best greasy spoon we have ever been to. A fun experience and a landmark for locals. Michael, our waiter, made certain we had everything we needed, was very kind, and attentive. We cant wait to go back."
389,xwSSUWfY0IRbvfVP76hX-A,"A wonderful gem we tripped over once we road the St. Charles line to the end! Don't miss! It is so worth the effort, super food, and service and venue a trip back in time! Just do it!"
390,vW7k_tnwcVqVegD2-bLqYw,"Been here twice before. I'm from NY where you can find legit diners all over town. Camellia grille is different from the typical ""diner"" because of it's unique atmosphere of watching the chefs cook and having the waiters/chefs really engaged with the customers and crowd. The food is above average, although be prepared to wait on line to be seated!!"
391,azP3MCFZDY7LOqQd2vrNrQ,"Food was very average, nothing special. Not horrible, not good. It's just around the corner from the house and it's open late and those are the best things about it. I do like the walking into another era feel the place has. Waiters in White jackets, classic bar stool seating, kinda cool. I just wish the food was a little better and a little more creative. It was just very, very lackluster tasteless food and putting a la mode on the pie cost as much as the pie, so that was unimpressive as well."
392,zrLHlPw52UN_hO5tNE91mg,pecan pie with vanilla blue bell ice cream. enough said.
393,VMKqDAxcWD5bPzKCmPyFMA,"Unless you go at odd hours, be prepared to wait.  This is your actual lunch counter and every seat faces the kitchen.  We were fortunate enough to have Marvin who is an absolute hoot.  If it were possible and/or legal, I'd like to have a can of Marvin in my purse on days when I'm feeling down.  

The food was delicious and came out very quick.  I was not a fan of the chocolate freeze as it looked like a shake mixed with ice.  Ice cream plus ice = no bueno.  Everything else was great."
394,coHanh5QstGrKZUWcnYhEw,"Excellent food, service and atmosphere. From the moment we walked in until the moment we left, the staff was amazing to us. Brun was our server and was friendly, attentive, and quick. He worked great with the chef as well. The chef perfected our food and we all loved our food. We were on a trip all the way from Texas and will definitely be returning to The Camellia Grill the next time we're in New Orleans!"
395,rUsiSpVFw6JKnpqIwnFrrQ,"It is awesome that there's a reliable place to eat greasy food on the late night tip here. The experience here is of higher quality than the food, but that doesn't mean I won't happily put down a bacon cheeseburger with impunity."

398,gbrxmuPdlKz6GCMERcyZWQ,"I don't understand the high rating. This place is very old and dirty. Bathroom is nasty, very gross. You go through the kitchen to get to the bathroom. I see pecan pies out on the kitchen table, guess waiting to be cooled. But, there are flies in the restaurant. Food is very greasy. Pancakes are not fluffy and greasy. Waffles are flat and thinner than the pancakes, floppy. Fries were just short one inch bits. Waffle House is better than this place and that is sad. Don't eat here."
399,m_MC3K4gykcEktP-lAkwsw,"Deliciously New Orleans! Camellia Grill is a must go-to for anyone living in or visiting New Orleans. The omelets are magically fluffy and gigantic, and the burgers are a cheap thrill. The freezes are delicious, especially orange. Service is typically impeccable."
400,sw5qi1Vh0xDiaAci6rmARQ,Historical and a good burger. The service was quick and friendly. Locals eat here worth the trolley ride to go eat here.
401,iPqtzN0TKzUHPKHzTb_Vlw,"Came here because of America Horror Story, going back because of the food. There was a bit of a wait, but it's so worth it!
Great friendly service, delicious food. The freezes are really good! Not to sweet. I ordered the waffles with bacon and egg- they give you a bottle of butter and syrup to spread over the top. Boyfriend ordered judges chicken and he devoured it."
402,xQaotnRCSnWPJ3dtxrXp2g,"This is just an old school diner that has remained virtually unchanged since 1946; which is great because they don't need to change anything.

The only bad aspect of Camellia is that there is often a line to get in and sometimes that line doesn't move nearly fast enough, as you have to watch other people eat and smell the good food!

They serve up some classic burgers, desserts, and a good selection of tasty sandwiches.  I'm not a breakfast person but you certainly can get that stuff here too.  I've usually eaten here for the night time / early morning time and it really hits the spot around then.  The burger is comparable to those that they want to charge way more for at the newer places on Oak and Freret but you get a lot more food options here with a burger that really tastes better."
403,whSkodJDcc_K3eGDksigtQ,I was super hungry when we arrived here. Waiting inside to be seated... The smell of the food is making me hungrier by the minute!!! Waiters are awesomely friendly & add a kick of character to their job making it fun to watch!
404,si9CGxDyxtvHr5i7j26gFA,"You can bet every time you come to Camellia Grill, you're not only going to enjoy the food (that's a given) but you are going to have an experience you enjoy. The staff is awesome but with one guy can't remember his name, but he said the whole restaurant down while all customers in all workers were in it and we did the mannequin challenge recorded it and put it on Facebook. Camellia Grill is one of those places that a part of New Orleans. Places like this, That make New OrleansA cool place it is for tourists and locals."
405,s-NgzcP3s6p30n57zQOd9Q,"My all time favorite greasy spoon. There's only so much you can do with waffles, burgers and eggs, but this place is magical and oozing charm. The pecan waffle is my go to, and the dedicated liquid butter dispenser speaks volumes about where this place is coming from food-wise. Marvin (RIP) was as courteous and friendly as could be, and he was known for using the exclamation ""Word"" in  his own way. A must visit and a short streetcar ride from Downtown and the French Quarter. Thank you Camellia Grill for all the perfect experiences and nary a false note."
406,-3D4G0XG52u9O6FHH96DIA,"Camellia Grill is a perfect choice for that late night greasy bite to eat. Typical Diner food and a relaxed atmosphere. The hot dog  poorboy is an outstandingly fatty treat, and their pie can't be beat."
407,gAsbK5U5rIq_wxzXIZZNdw,"I have some of the BEST Tulane memories from Camellia Grill! Hung over breakfast or burgers... this is the place to be. It's so unique and special and near and dear to my heart. There's only counter service and there aren't a ton of seats, which usually means you'll have to wait, but the experience of dining here and the food are worth the time spent outside. 

The omelettes are mixed in a milkshake-maker, causing a humongous fluffy omelette mess. They're terrific, although the egg can get a little too cooked for my taste. The breakfast sandwiches were always my favorite, however they are not for the faint (or cholested) of heart. (i know cholested is not a word, just go with it)

Burgers are also amazing and the location is terrific. This is a New Orleans classic, totally unique, and a Tulane student staple."
408,pEBcMFqNUTtNTm6L_a3vHg,"I thought I had written a review here before? I finally stopped in the Camellia Grill in the French Quarter. How can they be better then the one on Carrollton, I guess because they try harder. Nice staff, same food, same prices. That was the surprise, same prices on the food which will keep me going because after the BP Oil Spill most of my regular places in the Quarter went up in prices, a big jump. Lunch was running $20 a head  for a while. Now I can keep it below $10 with Camellia Grill open. Great freshly made hamburger, fries or onion rings keeps me going all day long. Stop in before everyone finds out and the lines form up like on Carrollton."
409,GX8Aujx0UkTnKAGyJmirvA,"Pretty decent service and has that old fashioned diner feel. Food was a bit on the greasy side, maybe a bit bland, but it was pretty good experience."
410,ALK4BUFNYcf5fHVn8GzDYQ,"This is my type of place. It's not fancy, there's no white table cloth, and the food is great. It's delicious food and even better service. You can't go wrong with that. We had a great selection of foods. I recommend ordering the Mexican omelette, a burger, and some red beans with catfish."
411,xCoKRZhMvOqLGlA65gZWAw,"This place is truly a NOLA staple, and rightfully so. The cooks and servers are the definition of enthusiastic. 

Camellia is one of the only diner spots I've come across in NOLA. Since I'm from NY, I'm used to hitting up diners at 3 am with my friends after a fun night out. This place is the perfect replacement for when I'm down here for school! 

The food is sooooo good. They have all your typical diner goodies, but something about this place makes it taste even better. My favorite has got to be the Manhattan omelette (go figure). 

You can also never go wrong with a burger and fries here. 

Dope spot."
412,Eb0a5T5dW_eUf63d7A9TxQ,"The Chef's omelet with chili is a must get! Terrific late night meal. Great meal, great servers & great atmosphere."
413,cGjMY2i-QjvbUUgw_SCZFg,A must for anybody that visits me. Great omelets and burgers. Can't beat the unique culture and vibe. You wont be disappointed.
414,Weak8NtRDFX1dECCmU4kUg,"Amazing food, great prices! The power went out and stayed out.. The food was still prepared, served and tasted yummy!"
415,x82sfhoMVJSDuUYI0-sZwQ,"I've been coming here since I was a wee tot sitting on my dad's lap. All the old crew is long gone now, sadly. Those guys worked here for 20-30 years!!  I digress...
In any case, I still love that not much else has changed here. The menu is consistently good. They keep it relatively simple: burgers, club & tuna sandwiches, waffles & last but, NOT least: the freezes!! Mocha freeze is the best!  They don't change the menu & they do it well."
416,hMC-RK9OoXt1FAJNrS0AWw,"Probably the best breakfast I had while in NOLA. This place gets busy quick and the cooks/Waiters treat you like family. Can't recall the name of the omellette I had but they should have called it the Kitchen sink! It had potatoes,onions, peppers, bacon, cheese, and Chili on top served with french fries. Perfect hangover remedy and was delish! This Place was def worth the trip!"
417,vf6Pc1Adzt9VFgr0CJIeew,"Waited in line to get in for about 25 minutes. ""It's too hot for this!"" I exclaimed to my lady while glancing over at a a perfectly fine looking breakfast place across the street. ""Babe, I was told we have to try this place."" She said, looking so pretty that I couldn't refuse. 

Finally we got in and noticed there were no booths or standalone tables. Nope... just a counter. We were seated another 15 minutes later and were scrunched up against, and I'm not trying to be rude, a very overweight family. However, they were rude. 

The menu was varied, southern breakfast items, etc. I ordered a waffle. I didn't get to eat it though. How could I? The place doesn't have butter. What they do have is a yellow, liquid they call butter. Yuck. 

The big dad beside me who coincidentally caused my legs to bend in an uncomfortable manner got the waffle as well, except while he waited he repeatedly said ""Ooh the waffles here are great. I only get the waffles because of the butter... oh, the butter... I just pour it all over because you got to have lots and lots of butter"" while hoisting up the dispenser. My appetite was fleeting as we each received our waffles. 

The staff is nice. We just had a pretty underwhelming experience and I'm almost certain that the guy next to me is dealing with artery issues."
418,oUk2h-AhsceTeyogNSpc7Q,"Camellia Grill, I still give you five stars!

You are amazing. 

You have melted butter in a syrup container. I could literally guzzle this down with nothing else.

My freeze was delicious and I actually drank/ate the entire thing. 

We ordered three, I am being so serious when I say this, three chef specials and licked the plate after each one. The chef gave us a funny look.

Keep being you!"
419,wetRkNAI5DnbMKZDhFwWGA,"Abosute worst service. Had a to go order waited 10 minutes beyond the quoted time, which wasn't a huge deal,but then I get home and realize they forgot the fries with my burger. Drive back to have the order fixed and was completely ignored for 10 minutes before I had to call someone over. I believe the server's name was Kenny."
420,p7BzHA4r3HO5dZOAEtBvig,"Beloved by locals and open 'til 2am on weekends, I was drunkenly transported here by new friends I met my first night in town (how's that for Southern Hospitality?) and was astonished by the seemingly endless variety of options. I couldn't much make sense of all the different things I could potentially get inside my belly but my monkey mind was insistently shouting that I wanted a burger so a burger is what I ordered, plain and simple. No frills, just a delicious perfectly cooked patty to soothe my groaning tummy after a night of hardcore boozing. The staff and customers are all interesting characters and I'm sure me and my group of rowdy pals only added to the delightful smorgasbord. If you're in New Orleans, you HAVE to stop by here, day or night, multiple times if you can, and try to work your way through the voluminous offerings. I've got my eye on an omelet and slice of pecan pie for next time.

THANK YOU to Vicky L., Jen L. and John L.H. (Lindsay A. and Josh B. were you there too? my drunken memory fails me) for showing me this f-ing amazing spot."
421,msVP6bWnG4AZm1Elva1u_g,"The chef's special omelet was pretty good, albeit huge. I could not finish it. The grits were sub-par, but for 89 cents, I couldn't pass up trying them. The chili, which was served on the omelet I ordered, was full of flavor. There is an interesting way of being seated here. The host(es) at the door will direct you to a bench on either side of the restaurant and when enough seats around the bar open up for your party, he/she calls you and points to those seats. They get upset with patrons who don't follow this order, so pay attention. All in all, this was a good place to try, but I'd probably go back for lunch instead of breakfast."
422,XngdHPncss4f9MdOdypySA,"I was a regular when I lived in New Orleans. My usual order is a burger (with cheese, dressed), fries, and a chocolate freeze. My family and friends swear by the pecan waffles and the omelets.
The staff is friendly, efficient, and fun. There is limited seating so if you have a large party, it may take a while to get adjacent seating. The seating itself is at the counter on stools, directly across from the waiters and cooks, hard at work.
There is often a wait because of the restaurant's popularity, but the staff works like a well-oiled machine, seating and satiating guests, all while providing pleasant and generally entertaining service.
Whether I am back in NOLA to visit or I am introducing friends to the area, I always pick the grill as a good place to eat. I have never been disappointed by the food, service, or prices."
423,P9PEf3dyNcNTAOS9ptEN6g,"Camellia Grill is small place with good service and good comfort food. I would definitely recommend the cheeseburger, chili cheese fries and the apple pie. Our waiter Varnel (apologizes if i messed up the name) was very pleasant and recommended places to see in the area. Good price for the food as well."
424,KdBZUu0Jcza1iadeikYCqg,I live walking distance to Camellia Grill. Its always packed and there's a reason why. The burgers are that DAMN good here. Try a bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions dressed. Pair that with a side of fries and an orange freeze. You will be saying hot diggity damn all the way home.
425,6WipZAXPNIT79Noc_Sqq-g,"This place was awesome!  At first it just seems like any old diner, but everything about this place is way better!!! I got a burger and fries, and this was one of the best burgers I've ever had!   

The service was great, and it was awesome to watch them make everything right in front of me!  I highly recommend eating here!"
426,rCoZMKvcjBEBXpLFpCY2Hg,"This place was a little far away from where we were staying but it was totally worth the trip over!! Two friends had recommended it, so I knew we had to try it. Glad we did! 

First off, there can be a wait. Went on a Monday morning at 11 and it was about a 15 min wait. I'm sure on a weekend it is much longer! The place has a very interesting set up- it has 2 large tables in u-shapes. Reminded me of a diner in the 50s! I frequent diners in nyc but this was unlike any I've been to.

I got an omelet, bf got waffles eggs and bacon. Everything was delicious!!! One of the best omelets I've had! Very quick service. We had Marvin as our waiter and he was so funny and friendy! He made our day! We got pecan and banana cream pie to go, which was a very good choice. Def try these if you come!!! The pecan pie seems to be their specialty. Overall great experience."
427,_2NkAARFD8eYm3n-4zVB8A,Staff and food are incredible. Staple of New Orleans. You can see tourists wandering off the street car any day just like a drunk kid at 11Pm
428,VIhwiDJp75xF5LHBfo6Mcg,"We came here based upon a recommendation from a friend and it did not disappoint! I got the potato and onion omelette and it was delicious. It felt like I was experiencing a true breakfast from the south. All of the servers were extremely nice and friendly. However, it is a small place. There isn't a huge seating area so it's not friendly for large groups. And you almost feel like you're sitting on top of your neighbors! Additionally, I felt a bit rushed overall from ordering to paying our bill."
429,c4QfcZotW8ZmdlsE11xjcw,"Eat here and get the best breakfast of your life. Make sure the depressed white guy isn't serving your food. I don't mean to bring out race but the group I was with split up and we got two different waiters because of the size of our group..our waiter ""Word"" was super nice and you could tell he loved his job and has been working at this place for a while.  My other friends' waiter must have had no where else to go for employment because that's what he looked like. He gave them less food and according to them, it was low quality. My group loved the food we got and came out rating it as the best breakfast ever. The pancakes were the best I've tasted period."
430,2m3hjkm1UpMzb-FjwS56wQ,"Will not be back here again. I paid around 10 dollars for an undercooked, pink on the inside,and not good burger. Staff uses their bare hands to cook and prepare your food. In no way am I I asking or want free food or my money back, I just will not be back."
431,ZQm-aEVvTqAcxJxPQWfQQw,Amazing!  This place is just wonderful.  Totally worth the wait if you go during a busy time-not to mention the food is awesome.  Service is like a 15 on a 1-10 scale.  I was so glad to come here that I can't wait to go back.  I would say if you are in New Orleans this is somewhere that is a must see! (and eat)
432,Snz8UbVYiHWijLSryIUl7Q,"Always worth the wait; and you will wait.  Once you're seated, though, you can pick anything on the menu and it will be great.  Everyone I know has a different favorite here.  My personal favorite is the Mexican omelette.

The staff is always friendly and always seems to be excited to be there.

A true New Orleans institution."
433,qTaAlsbmpeS9LgWuPhvuQA,"I had a hamburger po-boy and some very nice french fries at an apparently rare event, an unbusy time of day there. They even have a great red cream soda. I would have enjoyed having a piece of pie, but I just didn't have enough room for it. This is a place where I have to visit again next time I am in the area. :)"
434,xqDJurW5wdrGyrQKBWBf6A,"Ok, this place was an experience. Food was good. But, cleanliness is an issue for me. Don't even go to the bathroom, you will be petrified. Great service, though. Beef pot roast was good.  We ordered three other things on the menu. They were good and posted the pics. However, I can't get pass the fact that this place needs a good wall to wall scrubbing so I could not really enjoy my food. My mind was going through a whole different direction."
435,BDtcLE_Rn8jugcYhYHQv5g,"I love this place.  I live down the street so I have to ration myself on how often I go because otherwise I would be there all the time.  

The food is delicious and cheap.  I always get a chef's omelet with the chili and fries.  I have never finished the whole thing in one go, but I always feel satisfied.  I took some visitors there the past weekend and they both loved it too.  One of them kept asking when we could come back (and she was only here for three days).  

Chocolate pecan pie is great.  Cheeseburgers are classic.  Service is fun and fast.  It's one of my favorite experiences in New Orleans."
436,QX7KvjvMLHWXS2zRe137XA,"The service was fast, the food was tasty, although next time I must say I would order differently.  We arrived a little late for breakfast, so ended up going for Lunch.  My partner is Vegetarian, and there weren't very many options for her on the menu.  She opted for a Grilled Cheese on wheat, and a ""Salad"" which consisted of some shreds of lettuce previously destined for a hamburger and a couple of similarly fated tomato slices.

I opted for a diner sandwich, the Mardi Gras.  The corned beef was very sinewy, making it hard to eat, but it tasted great.

Our lunch was rudely interrupted by a roach skittering across the floor, but hey, it's New Orleans, they are everywhere.

The saving grace of the meal was the chocolate cherry freeze and th pecan pie.  These two items made the above entirely bearable.  Next time,  I know exactly what I will be ordering, and I hope to give them more stars."
437,nvNiD53RDIWbGitjugE_cA,"Oh, the Camellia Grill...how I wish you were still open 24 hours.  Doesn't everyone need a pecan waffle at 3 a.m. on occassion?  Well too bad if you do since they actually close these days.  So sad.

The chocolate freeze is amazing.  E always craves their pecan pie.  And I am a sucker for their pecan waffle anytime of day. Last time my brother got the turkey club and was really pleased to see it was actual sliced turkey.

That said, I won't wait in ridiculous lines to eat here.  The last couple of times I've been, I've walked right in and then within 15 minutes the line is out the door."
438,EpiX0fp9wIhEM4f24UzsPQ,"Addictive. Tasty burgers and onion rings and fries... I just keep coming back. 

It's a small place, so don't be surprised if you have to wait to sit at the counter during the normal busy hours. The service is fast, the food is good (in a greasy way), and it's great fun to watch the quick work of the fry cooks and servers (who also make your freezes, set up the dressing for sandwiches, etc.). 

And seriously, don't be that person who wastes the waiters' time. They're busy!

Side note: Cold Stone is directly next door, so it makes for a good dinner and dessert evening. (I tried the chocolate creme pie at Camellia Grill on one occasion and it was pretty bad, so I'd suggest just sticking to the hot stuff that they do so well there and then going next door for dessert.)"
439,oHneozAdbvnDbcrmF2JVqg,"Still good 40 yr later. ..and open til 1200 a.m. friendly wait staff and cooks. Treat everyone like family.  They act like a famiky, a team. If something us not made up, they never say they ran out; they'll whip it right up for you will no crabbing or acting it's a huge favir. They like to coik. Their nightime cook is fabulous. And, it's clean. They still have the weird little bathroom through the huge kitchen and stools around the counter to sit at and eat. Even their cashier is funny and friendly.  It always makes you want to come back. All the locals come there and are on a first name basis with the staff."
440,JUrY1Dm15Fe_1qW_ejZ7AQ,One of my friends is going to NOLA and I told her she must visit this place. I went Jan 2017 and I cannot forget how much I enjoyed eating here. The food was delicious (all 3 of us loved what we got) and the service was great.
441,lrKLBu99u2J-933CKLp6qw,"Great place for breakfast! They are really friendly, the food is hot and yummy and you can even order booze :) 
I've only been for breakfast but next time I'm in town, I want to try the lunch or dinner menu."
442,LFcq7eKYB4ftqrtObw-rUA,"I hoped this authentic-seeming New Orleans diner was the right place to experience authentic New Orleans cuisine! But Camellia was a disaster. First, the service was terrible--extremely slow. The conditions also looked completely unsanitary: flies were all over the salt and pepper shakers, and every time food was delivered, it seemed like a ""Camellia's"" thing for it to slide on the counter first. When I ordered my red beans and rice things got no better: first a gross-looking hamburger patty arrived on a small plate with nothing else. About 10 minutes later I got an enormous plate with lots of beans dripping over the side and a little strip of white rice in the middle. I mixed the rice and beans, then added the hamburger as I was supposed to, and, by the time I finished mixing all the gross-looking pieces, the stuff in front of me looked no more like something I wanted for dinner. At this point my friend doubled down in stomach pain because her gumbo was equally bad: gruelly and thin. As for the famous Camellia's pecan pie that everyone always recommends, it was slimy and dry. I've definitely had better. (From Costco).

About the only way Camellia succeeds is in the 1950s nostalgia department. The old-style stools are nice and the counter is nice. But the food is terrible and the service is terrible. Not worth indulging your nostalgia. You want burgers, fries, or chicken nuggets?  McDonalds also has a long history--76 years, as opposed to Camelllia measly 60 years. For a $10 meal, I have had much better."
443,VJvDYpHLYba0rM9VxroRMw,Great place got to ask for Marvin. Love the burgers.   Warning u may have to wait.   It's worth it.
444,7qGXLC6FAdi2uUcdIVa7PA,"So so so delicious!! I had a waffle and my friends had on letters. The one with corned beef is super super yummy and when the hash row s are brown they are awesome too! My bacon was good but could have been warmer. The food today was OUTSTANDING, the word of the day. Yummy!!!"
445,EEk_3oMsne-we8NMPZtAng,"Go.  Just go.  Wait if you have to.

Line isn't so bad as it sees.

Omelets are killer (we had a bacon omelet).  Service/ambiance awesome.  C'mon.   Just go.  Why aren't you going.  Put your damn phone away and go.  A NOLA institution.  

It's what a diner should be.

But don't wait til your hangover passes, go early, line builds up quick on weekend mornings.  Plus it's probably better hungover because it's diner food."
446,dfOgp1LuTu1tj1B96y3vIQ,"Last meal in new Orleans and I wanted pecan pie. We came here, spilt a burger. The food is regular diner food, which is fine by me, and the pecan pie is amazzzzing. However, it was slow when we went and the service was not good. Had to fill up our own waters and had issues at the register. Go for yourself to try, but I won't be coming back next time I'm in NOLA."
447,AljkZB-T4qvyxhKEQAru2Q,"What an experience!!
Eating here was interesting in many ways! 
First of all the waiter was talking to the waitress in front of us for few minutes before he said hello to us..the hello was unengaged and totally disconnected as he continued his conversation with the gal while slapping couple plastic menus on the bar and couple waters. 

My partner ordered chicken fingers and fries and I ordered the ""word""..hot sausage sandwich...the waiter made a comment that he doesn't understand why people would come to New Orleans and order chicken fingers! My meal supposedly was more of a NOLA favorite! 
When he served us, he said is his own funny way ""here is your damn chicken fingers""..huh??

The food was nothing exceptional, in fact the chicken fingers were over cooked and a bit dry..a generous portion of the fries tho.
My sandwich was ok..not hot enough for me and no fries, when I asked what comes with my sandwich I was told nothing but he was kind enough to bring me a side of French fries at no cost.

I was concerned about how sanitary this place was..they were touching each other as they chatted , looking at their phones..adjusting their weaves and no gloves in sight!

The staff members were young, obnoxious, rude and disrespectful..with no care in the world!

We won't be going back!"
448,lyWD0rHOtOD6E5UTunUCxg,Great location with extra points for being open late (until 2am Friday and Saturday!). So fun to sit at the counter and talk to fellow night owls either continuing the party or winding down.  Staff are fun and friendly; our server Dennis was cheerful even at such a late time and the food was fast. Not the best burger I've had (my patty was overcooked and a little burnt) but the bacon was on point and the onion rings fulfilled the greasy food craving perfectly. A must-do eatery for someone out so late with a hunger that fast food won't curb.
449,3_YwK8re5KPxHw2o6iYu_g,"This place is a popular ""lunch counter"" in the RiverBend section of NOLA. You often have to wait,  but the line moves pretty quick because it is a lunch counter. This means that you should be prepared to order, eat, pay and leave. Don't linger after you finish  eating as there are usually many others waiting for you to leave so they can eat. The portions are good and reasonably priced for the quality. Good breakfast or meal after night out after drinking type of place."
450,XmE_-1PtmLRpBgvJfQU2sA,One word AMAZING! Food is great and always has been great. Even before Katrina this was the go to spot. This is a family favorite. Just wish the place was a little bigger so they can fit more people in there. The line that is outside on weekends is unbelievable sunshine or rain that should tell you something about Camellia Grill.
451,sXsEgmw5WOnYDYP6MWf6ag,"Our cab driver highly recommended we have breakfast at The Camellia Grill. So happy we followed his advice. Fun atmosphere and staff. Food was delicious. Hubby had the Manhattan omelet and I had waffle and grits. Very pleased with our choices and will definitely add this stop to any future trip to NOLA.
We took the St. Charles streetcar from Canal St.. Lovely ride through the Garden District a plus!"
452,QcvumWrLJIRdsmw2XxAugA,Loved this place growing up. Over the last year I have tried to eat here twice feeling sick as heck afterwards. Maybe it's too much fat or grease. At least the waffles don't make me sick :(
453,B5LvvJ8lLay1KI7iHqpxHA,"Classic New Orleans. A blast from the past. It's a must visit for tourists. However, beware, go after the typical lunch hour, they serve breakfast and lunch and it's PACKED.  

A tourist must visit."
454,0uPcGh2tr-V7IwfhguAC5g,"Been coming here for over 30 years and it is always great. They do something to their omelets that makes them so light & fluffy - I actually think they whip the eggs on n an old fashioned milkshake maker. We had the bacon & cheese with some added sliced breakfast sausage. Yummy! We got it with perfect hash browns, but of course they have grits, too. The omelet is quite large so we split it. I recommend you get there early so you can grab the few available street parking spots."
455,zaxXCtGzaDq63ksv6n6cxw,"Amazing food. Ate here a few times during my one week stay at the quarter house with my boyfriend. We wish we'd eaten here every day!

My boyfriend is a very picky eater but he loved this place. We have very different tastes. We tried several things on the menu, nothing disappointed.

I imagine that if you're looking for healthy menu options then this is definitely not the place for you."
456,WNDGzORfATwgvQ5PYZEDsA,"Best diner in New Orleans.  Scratch that, best diner in all of America.  NO!  I will go for it....best diner in all the world!!!

I have eaten ham and cheese omelets at every establishment I have ever been to that will serve them.  Camellia's is the best I have ever had.  I haven't been there post-Katrina, but I hope it is every bit as delectable as ever.  

WORD."
457,oZWTruXkzRe4bP8br2hP8w,"This was the best BLT I've ever had!! I love seeing young brothers hard at work.
To the short order cook with the dreads, keep doing ya thing!!"
458,cIDyfge9jO7v5qK3REP9sQ,"WOW. This was my first stop in New Orleans and it did not disappoint. I wish we had something like this at home. The service, phenomenal. The food, spectacular and full of flavor.  The environment, classic breakfast counter. Get the frozen milk freeze, even at 10 in the morning it was delicious, no regrets. I can't wait to go back."
459,GjRN4mg6UlXZdMUIrgA2hA,Used to visit camellia a lot in college. Things are still the same here. Chili cheese omelette was delish. Chocolate freezes for breakfast yes please. Unique atmosphere and everyone should visit here once.
460,-I6H7k_tq1q94yFBoXLTtg,Best bacon cheeseburger!!! Bacon Cheeseburger goes great with a side of fries and brown gravy for fry dipping!!! Sit with Leon!!! He's GREAT!!!!
461,O_z9oqwd7vl7lNKdewCWqA,Marvin is the best waiter on staff. The burgers are absolutely a great post hangover remedy along with the omelettes. The waffles are awesome and the food is plenty in portion size.
462,hKZx2FeZpu9qNN0SpZHvLg,"RODENTS RIGHT UP FRONT!!!!  Unbelievably, as a New Orleans native I had never eaten at Camelia Grill, so I decided to go during a recent visit home in December.  Let me say that the trek to the restroom is pretty scary.  Never seen anything like it, but it was actually cleaner than the dinind area once I got there.  We ended up exiting quickly and without a scene as near the end of our meal we noticed a rodent observing us from behind the counter.  That notwithstanding, the food is nothing remarkable.  I have no idea why there's usually a line to get in here.  I know it's NOLA and we have these things not only there, but any place.  I just don't want to see it.  Bad dining night in The Crescent City.  Sadly, we were there because we'd just left Port of Call Downtown because of a huge roach on the table.  At least Port of Calls food and drinks do warrant a line to get in."
463,GVWBgu7PZAr26DE2Gx-Jyg,"Outstanding old school diner atmosphere. We had the chef's special omelette along with a pancakes, sausage and bacon plate.  The food is prepared right in front of you.  Our server has been working there 24 years. Lots of history and folks who were brought here as a kid now bringing their kids. Great food, great people and the pricing was not bad at all.  Definitely a place you should visit on a hungry belly."
464,FOWoT7sc6kDqKhDgYpkW5Q,"Never disappoints.   Wonderful food, service and other patrons make for the perfect diner experience.  A 30-40 minute streetcar ride from Lafayette Square area allows the whole St. Charles Ave. experience to/from the Grill.  It's a special place that you hope never changes."
465,5bxS61OqVmkyzi20-zu1vw,"Well I stumbled upon this place while looking for a quick breakfast. I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in the door and sat at the counter where the kitchen was open, there was nothin but counter seating, and the overall retro feel of the place.
I sit down and am greeted by an extremely nice waiter.  I order a cheese omelet with jalapeños and grits, the food came out quick and it tasted great. My friend ordered the manhattan omelet, which was make with corned beef, and hers was also delicious.  
The most amazing thing about this place was the atmosphere. All the cooks and waiters were dressed with bow ties, and every one was extremely nice and funny.  The staff was joking around with each other the whole and it was very entertaining. There was also a very cute waiter named Phillip;) haha.  Overall this was an atmosphere and experience I will never forget."
466,6gN8z82POBBzHevRCs3UyA,Mmmm.  Omelette's juicy inside crispy outside.  Huge.  Pecan Waffle with plenty o pecans.  Scrumptuliescent.  Deliciomazing ! Uh
467,cEDArSkb0dgI75aHXsyEZQ,"I have been coming here since the mid 80's and it was a cool institution and like so many neighborhood places a quirky and interesting place to eat. Lately its become a disneyesque like version of its former self serving mostly the tourist crowd. On a recent visit here I was dismayed that the place was not well maintained and in all honesty, was more like a greasy spoon. The floors for example really need a good scrubbing and waxing and in general it was not nearly as clean as I remembered. The waffles are still in my book excellent and some of the best and the service staffed tried very hard. You pay your check at the door and you really need to actually look at your receipt, in my case I was mistakenly charged $100 for a $13.00 tab by the cashier. It was quickly corrected, but you gotta pay attention here."
468,QuH5Zk5ZD6HHdnDxII4oCQ,After a rough night of moving heavy furniture this all late night spot was exactly the remedy for weariness. The reuben I had a was good as the bread was toasted just right. However the entertainment provided by the waiter/cooks was incredible. These guys had me cracking up throughout the meal.
469,Wq-rdUAzXlLLqQLFcRzFLA,"Still craving the delicious burger, onion rings and deep fried mac and cheese.  Service was friendly and excellent.  Food was to die for in terms of diner food.  Felt like I was in Edward Hopper's Nighthawks.  When I go back to NO I will most certainly revisit Camillia Grill... no doubt."
470,T2riILWfSPuYzqJbkPbmtw,"Waaaay too expensive for the quality, and for me, too greasy to be enjoyable.  A lot of my NOLA friends swear by this place, but I just can't find anything I like here aside from their chocolate freeze, which is a chocolate milk shake and incredibly delicious.

Not somewhere to take kids that aren't able to sit on an open stool to eat.  Not somewhere for groups because there is limited seating.  

I should add that the food is made in an open kitchen, not five feet from where customers are sitting.  Ew."
471,7x7s3HgsiH9mDBK8j5LofQ,"Double Cheeseburger, Fries, Chocolate Freeze. Counter seating only and if the line's out the door, go someplace else, but keep driving by until the line isn't out the door and go back."
472,PNfCAnOXg1rD31u3M4V-_g,"We had a personal recommendation and it did not disappoint. The wait staff was attentive and engaging, the food prepared to perfection."
473,kwRpu66gQQDe380n6xpUyw,If you like diner's this is a classic joint that you should visit - We took the cable car from downtown and stopped off for breakfast.  We thoroughly enjoyed the pecan waffles and huge omelette's... great coffee too.   The whole place sits on bar stools and there is great interaction between everyone there.  Great atmosphere.  I've posted a few of my shots above.
474,2ERUdLUxi39vwC1em8nRbg,"As good as ever. Everyone should eat here at least once. Be it for breakfast or late nite. Had the bacon burger, onion rings,and a freeze. My friend (her first time eating here) had the club with fries. Raved about how good it was. Simple food done well."
475,qVD5yCKJ5ZDirtntBPGEnw,unfortunately the food is highly overrated. the service was good and a fun atmosphere but this is a tourist trap. we are sticking with our rule of thumb: don't wait in long lines for food in new orleans
476,2wBlsh7gL9B1cE5f2UgGcw,"What an amazing southern diner GREAT SERVICE, AMAZING AND FILLING FOOD,and overall great ambience. The chef's omelette is INSANE and the chilli cheese fries are on point. A must repeat for sure!"
477,zc8KMt3EqRMA9j24jvgmsQ,"After a long flight and a tough week of boozing, I needed some comfort food, and this is the place for it.

It's a historical food-mark. Stepping inside the loud laughter and banter hits you with a punch, you are in NOLA now baby. All the servers cook and serve your food from behind the grill, it's like stepping into the 50's. The servers wear white uniforms and they are the happiest funniest bunch I have ever met. They where like a bunch of Santas with their deep chuckling and back slapping.

I had difficulty pouring the ketchup on my burger due to lack of a proper functioning body due to pickling it the past week with copious amounts of alcohol. The server took it from my hands without me even noticing and like a father to his child, poured it for me... Now that is service.

The cheeseburger was amazing but the chocolate milk shake or 'freeze' as they call it down here was off the hook.

Sitting around the grill eating where teenagers on their first dates, professionals, senior citizens and college students covered in tattoos... This place is that good and special.

As I left to pay, our server exchanged punches... I know I sound so Irish and white saying that but I don't know the expression for doing a greeting that I only see P Diddy do. I also looked really scared doing it as I had no clue what was going on, but hey my server treated me like P Diddy.

Leaving the place we got to experience a very loud and proud New Orleans restaurant shout,
'Who dat?!' 
Come on the Saints!"
478,JGHSZgiqAqdX6w1ibXn6bg,"OMG BEST OMLETTE EVER. Our wait wasn't too terrible, and the food comes out veryyy fast. The servers/cooks are pretty entertaining and keep you busy while you're waiting. Definitely one of the best greasy spoons I have ever been to. Open late and all day long for breakfast stuff!!"
479,igm6Z5kOI50JfACTECo9RA,Great home cooked feel breakfast joint. Food was delicious and the staff was on point. Noise level was at a minimum and we were seated within 5 mins. I heard that there's usually a line but I guess we got lucky! Definitely a spot we'd go back to.
480,CsCbNpYz1Z1T9wM64arkug,Off the chart food and service. Couldn't stop eating my one eyed buck before my cheese fries arrived. Our server was friendly and made the family comfortable. Give the place a chance and you won't be disappointed.
481,zprPwCFmljeITerJ6eLMZA,"My two sons both study in New Orleans (one at Loyola University and the other at Tulane).  On one of my first trips to visit them, they made a point of taking me to the Camellia Grill. Boy, am I glad that they did.  What a great place!  The burgers are fabulous, as are the enormous omelettes.  It's fun to sit elbow to elbow at the counter and make new friends of strangers while taking in the floor show that the cooks provide.  I wouldn't dream of visiting NO without at least one trip to the Camellia Grill."
482,aSPaCA3cT4Hi46zdbo7NyA,"Leon is charming and awesome,
My omelette was plentiful, not greasy and tasty, fast service.  All its missing is Fresh Squeezed OJ"
483,-9k-C0Ap2hSBJL58kBBQaA,"The service alone is worth the long line. The cooks and servers were friendly and outgoing, and announced the word of the day (outstanding!) to the whole place. I had a chef's special omelet, and it was amazing. I'm not a huge hashbrown fan but these were cooked just right. I'm a bit of a coffee fiend, so I have to point out that their coffee is spectacular. Smooth and rich and just...incredible. Soooo good. My boyfriend had a waffle that he was obsessed with, although it was just pretty good to me. The freezes are also excellent. Overall: OUTSTANDING."
484,h0wJ_y20VRhNDMoMdU_P3Q,"We came here on our first day at New Orleans for breakfast. 

It's a ""sit wherever you like place"" so that's a good thing. There are three serving stations and you basically sit around those.

We had the omelette with hash browns in the side with toast. Everything was amazing! The servers were really friendly and helpful.

Definitely a must to go if you are in New Orleans!"
485,Aan_uoMoDO1tZXQuB5zYQw,Get the grilled chocolate pecan pie w ice cream. Seriously.
486,AxOs3Q-aJ0XaMA5SRWeJrg,"We just got off a cruise and found this place on Yelp, so my partner wanted to try it.   So we were seated and met right away by our server who was super nice and gave good service.   However while perusing the menu I saw the cook/chef touching food ungloved.  Everything he did was ungloved.  That freaked me out so I ordered grits which were spooned and hash browns.   While giving me my order the server pointed out a liquid butter on the counter to use to squirt the liquid onto things.  Yuk.  The counter tops were sticky and so was the menu.  I just had a feeling of a lack of cleanliness.   I would not go back, counter service on small short bar stools isn't my thing.  Neither is the ungloved hand while handling food.  The food was tasty but greasy,  good quick service.  I am really shocked by all the great reviews with so many wonderful places in Nola."
487,FJwUjw3luzLExF7UPS7AMA,"Great food and reasonable prices - on my 2nd visit 10 years later!
The wait is too long!!!  Should renovate the restaurant to accommodate MORE guests.  There are only about 24 seats in the restaurant.  It is too much to wait over an hour for bfast."
488,ToJjhbrFxDU16NOQOfLg8Q,"Some of the absolute best cheap food in town. My friends always get the chili cheese omelet, but I prefer the simple but juicy burger with a side of fries. Also, the orange freeze is delicious. Camellia is an absolute must for anyone visiting NOLA. What makes it even better is that the servers are always friendly and they stay open late (around 2am)."
489,g-7Y_tg5oWar3N8AJCNZqg,"This is what it tastes like to ride into the sun. Both of the times I've been here, I've had a burger. Both of the times I've been here, I've left satisfied. I cannot recommend it highly enough. The chili cheese fries are absolutely incredible as well. If you have a fancy for something sweet, make sure to get a freeze. Grab a cook's attention and let him know what you want, then leave him a nice tip at the end for his efforts. This is solid New Orleans cuisine, open just late enough to give you a goal post-Bourbon Street."
490,H4CwyM79UoCFFjKKtdLu2A,"i will not dwell on the obvious awesomeness of this place.  tip one: get a fried egg on your bacon cheeseburger.  tip two: order a dark waffle.  tip three: wrap said burger inside said waffle and consume them. tip four: always get a chocolate or orage freeze.  every time!

also, if there's a huge line and you're not there for the experience, go to cooter brown's across the street, order some oysters and beer, call in your order, then go pick it up.  beats waiting an hour.

marvin is the man. word."
491,rod-WfilNijnx__g941FfQ,"This is one of those not-to-miss experiences in New Orleans.   Watching the folks behind the counter is a treat in itself. It's like you're watching a well choreographed play. And the food is plentiful, hearty,  and delicious.  When it's your turn, you belly up to the bar along with Tulane students, locals, and tourists.  You can't really go wrong here,  but if you want to try something special go with the chef's special omelette. Really tasty. Chock-full of meat and cheese slathered in great chili.  We are two big guys with big appetites,  and we split one and were well satisfied."
492,830xhMnfGSTFwvfL31_XBw,"For us, a trip to NOLA is not complete without a meal at the Camellia Grill. We always stay in the French Quarter and love taking the streetcar out to have lunch. As in the past, this year did not disappoint - the burgers are delicous and the cherry chocolate freeze was wonderful. We'll be back next year!"
493,HHAPL1_KmFtmWvW4MWnFtA,"After riding the St. Charles streetcar for 45 min, this place did not live up to my expectations. My boyfriend's burger was burnt and rubbery, and they charged us for 2 fries when we had only ordered one. In their defense it was a very busy day, but I was expecting so much more from a place that is supposed to be a must visit in New Orleans."
494,xvYUNC8EtX-_1CN76h1X9A,"There's no better treatment for a hangover than a good chocolate freeze and greasy breakfast.  For those that have posted about the simple diner atmosphere - you're absolutely right - but what it may lack it complexity and design, it makes up for with the customer service.  Its one of the few places that makes me smile when I'm called ""baby"" or ""sweetheart.""  (Even more so when my male family members get called those things, too!)"
495,eWYD2Wyj_idL53mSw8dWUg,"Depending on when you go and how many in your party (the fewer the shorter the wait) waits can be minutes to an hour or more. However, once inside and seated at the counter, which is the only kind of seating) your server will make sure that the experience is a good one. The food is good given the prices which are still incredibly fair. The burgers are good, French fries are served hot and golden brown.

Based on what we saw breakfast is really the menu champ!"
496,zwDX0X41uqoxb-rHsM7_kQ,"This place has gone down hill since my last visit. Service was good, food just okay. I heard they have new owners. The magic was missing."
497,QhMFIaOFVz9wxG1tFtaRYw,"Thankfully there was no wait...Because as everyone knows, there is almost always a long line stretching down the block. I'm not the patiently-waiting-in-line type.

The food was more than good - I had a western omelette. Cheap, plentiful and greasy. Engaging servers, ""get to know your neighbor seating"" in a loud, smell of grease in the air diner. I thought the omelette was too big at first, but I powered through it and promptly drove home before the food coma set in. My only real complaint is they have Tabasco and not Louisiana (or Crystal) hot sauce. 

I've actually eaten there many times, but only when there is no line!"
498,TE0ZFKrAlprwaVimHJRTQw,"Let's get one thing straight, The Camellia Grill isn't for everyone. Part of its charm is the experience of dining there. On my visit, there were several tourist and several locals who were there for lunch. This fact makes for a very eclectic clientele. If you're not comfortable with this, I'd advise you not to go. I had the cheeseburger and fried macaroni on my visit. The burger was fried with a very nice crunch on the outside. The grilled onions I asked for were also very good. Not sure how they did it, but the burger brought to mind the homemade burgers my mom used to make. The fried macaroni was also very good - crunchy and cheesy. My companion had French fries with her burger. They were very good, too. The staff was friendly and attentive and put on a good show. I'd consider The Camellia Grill as a must visit for anyone visiting New Orleans."
499,XsVgyFTtReBd2buWhmBgQA,"Have to love this place for what it is. Great local diner that dresses their food in butter and grease. Could never eat here everyday, but it's fantastic now and again. The chili is fantastic, and the omelets are bizarrely large. Great staff and fairly inexpensive."
500,8FoB5WDT8k5cGSTHKPF-FQ,Service was amazing and the food was the best we've had during our entire stay in New Orleans!! We were served fast and just overjoyed with the ENTIRE experience. We told them we had a flight to catch and they promptly found us seats!!!! Love love love this place!! A must visit!!!!!
501,6D5Yc_sXtRx2WVNijnLmgg,"Wow!! I was so pleasantly surprised with this place!! We went to New Orleans for the zoo and I found this place on yelp. When I first walked in I was taken back by how small it was inside. The three men behind the counter were awesome. The food was great and my kids loved it. The only thing I would say negative is that it felt a bit rushed due to such limited seating, but I'm so glad I found this place!!"
502,B41wYMCjbp2spoutB6NTbA,"Two pair of old geezers dressed in tuxedos, walk into the restaurant about 5 minutes after I sat down in the evening on St. Patty's Day. They were told as I was told that they only had hamburgers and omelets left. I was a little pissed about this, but at 12:30 in the Quarter, after running around all day, dodging parade traffic, tired as hell, I couldn't be too picky. 

The geezers weren't happy about this, their wives were indifferent and complacent, probably much in the same way as they are about their marriages to these assholes. They all order burgers. The last asshole in the group wants bacon. So their server says, ""sorry, out of bacon"". The geezer goes apeshit. Evidently he owned a restaurant for two years in New Orleans and they never ran out of anything, except obviously business. 

The cook, Will, got up in his face about his irrational behavior and the two went at it. I'm laughing the whole time and realized, at this moment, I was truly in New Orleans. The men storm out yelling ""This is ridiculous! You don't run out of f*cking bacon"", the women compliantly follow. The server at this point says ""There is no reason for obscenities"" To which the geezer replies ""F*ck you"". Two seconds after they walk out the place screeches to a halt. Will says with a middle finger raised, ""You know what, ""F*ck Him!"" The entire restaurant cheers. I'm still laughing hysterically. 

My meal was about as good as any greasy diner. I rate the place based on what it is. I'm not going into the place looking at it like a 5 star restaurant with a sophisticated menu. I'd say the food was about 4 stars but i knock an extra star up for experience. It's sometimes more important than the food. When I am entertained AND fed, I'm very happy. 

The men work hard, aim to please and they are all cool as sh*t. My server even gave me a free slice of pecan pie as a welcome to New Orleans. Everyone was super friendly from the chef all the way down to the bussers. I even got a fist-bump here and there. I'm a fan of the fist-bump personally. 

A few minutes after the altercation the server apologizes  to the entire restaurant, ""I'd like to apologize folks, unfortunately we do have assholes in New Orleans"" 

Yes, that is true, but they aren't on the working side of the counter."
503,Lk3R3tbgltWjAn7qfmph_A,"The Camellia Grill (Black Pearl) ... a traditional diner with only counter seating. Very nostalgic, and a good example of why diner-style restaurants have disappeared from across America. The food is just OK, hot and filling, nothing spectacular. The counter restricts seating and imposes wait times on customer number 20 and above, which may seem longer because of the heat and humidity.

That said, the grill cooks move at the pace the seated customers eat, the hostess was pleasant, and our server, William, was entertaining.  Two stars for the food, and one star for being an authentic blast-from-the-past.

I especially enjoyed the grill cook whipping up eggs and batters in a malt mixer ... makes for fluffy omelets and pancakes."
504,dc_tvYfF0_7aRTSSZ5qTvA,"Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! I was so uncomfortable sitting in the place, eating anything, or drinking anything. The waiter was nice but terrible food. I will never go back to this restaurant."
505,da8AGpRNqUve4z_moOOW6Q,"I love a place that serves breakfast all day.  Nothing like getting a big omelet after a night of drinking!  They have very good omelets and fried potatoes.  Also, the burgers are the really thin kind on a buttery toasted bun.  And don't forget about the milkshakes!  YUM!  Sitting at the counter is also fun for a change."
506,Dnsm77HccD1Mo3yZWWaUug,"This is a counter restaurant. You sit at the counter order eat and leave. Enjoying watching the cooks prepare your food and everyone else's food!  
They made my mom feel special on her birthday by singing Happy Birthday!!"
507,kv7DG5am134IGV_bgOml_Q,Another amazing breakfast.  Worth the wait.  Every Jazzfest a must.  Gotta get the Pecan Waffle with the Fried Pecan Pie.  Together.   Heaven on a plate
508,YvFxBwZxWjWw-6SJSt1zag,"I had an incredible time at Camellia Grill!! It definitely lives up to all the hype! I loved the seating around the cooking ""stage."" Everything here works like clockworks. The chefs and servers know how to make and serve some amazing food!!

Our server Brun recommended us the delicious Chef's special omelette and chocolate pecan pie. He kindly split it into two portions for my brother and I on two plates. Boy, oh boy was it delicious and filling. The omelette was chock full of ingredients, fluffy, and perfectly seasoned while an incredible chili on top!! Yummmmm~~

To complete our late brunch, we had the chocolate pecan pie. HEAVEN. Brun toasted it on the grill for extra ooey-gooey-ness, drizzled chocolate sauce, and added a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream for the ultimate sweet tooth delight. It's only been three hours since I had it but I'm already craving it again. BEST PECAN PIE I'VE EVER HAD. Holy moly. 

It was just right. Not too sweet. Perfect balance of pecans vs pie filling. Perfect crunchy crust. I will never forget this dessert. Thank you Camellia Grill for not only being delicious but kind and welcoming. Thanks again, Brun!!"
509,X19ufH1PGtpGxzDLycxfrQ,"Top 3 breakfast experiences I've ever had, great prices, quality omelettes, interactive service and overall atmosphere. Very lovely times indeed."
510,1OfUamYKcfPlwRmHlmjbPQ,"I have been a devotee for 45 years since I moved to N.O.  I love their cheeseburgers as well as the pecan waffle and no meal is complete without a chocolate Freezie!!!  Absolutely the only criticism I have of Camellia Grill is that a few years ago they moved the stools at the bar closer to each other to add in a few seats.  I always feel like I am sitting in the lap of the person next to me.  It's fine if it is someone I know and love, but if it is a stranger...  I'm not skinny, but if you sit next to someone really heavy it is not a good situation.  Consequently, I try to go at a time when it is not super busy so I can sit on one of the corner seats.  Other than that I love it - good food plus a floor show!"
511,rMkuAkPQfhff3cHLSaOPrA,"The Burgers were delicious and omlettes were light and fluffy!! I recommend the Manhattan omelette or the One Eyed Buck, but anything u get is sure to be great! Except I did not like the seating arrangments."
512,wtmN7_XUhWM3tFhwCgmqYQ,"Worst experience ever!! I drive way out of my way at 8:30 in the morning for a bacon cheeseburger dressed with grilled onions.  I have been talking about this burger for 24 hours now and this is all I want. I get to camellia grill ready for my burger, but no! They are out of burgers, which is ridiculous for a place that has a huge section on their menu and pride themselves on their burgers. I hate to say it, but I refuse to go back! In the end I ended up spending $26 basically on a blt and left totally unsatisfied still craving my burger. That's the last time I go to the ""wonderful"" camellia grill."
513,z45GBIT-qxgrIc0s8hdVgQ,"4.5 stars
Massive omelets. Great service. Very unique little place with counter-only seating. Typical diner fare along St. Charles. Waiter was awesome, (I think his name was Leonard?) I tried the fried Mac and Cheese bites, which were a huge win. It said 6 on the menu, but I somehow ended up with 9 bites. My dining companions ate omelets with sausage and cheese and bacon and cheese and they loved theirs. The great service really stood out to us as the waiter was very personable and friendly. We came at a great time (around 5pm) so as to avoid the crazy breakfast and lunch rushes.Great little stop for yummy breakfast. No 5th star because it wasn't the best breakfast we'd ever had but it was still very good."
514,62wm4oZZ_3-o7WICxq_f-A,"Two words: hot pecan pie ala mode!!!   Unbeatable anywhere!   Re other food, your engaging waiter will tell you that ""everything is good"" at The Camellia Grill, and we believe it.  Teresa splurged and never regretted eating a bacon double cheeseburger (no photographic evidence, please) while I greatly enjoyed the Word (sausage) sandwich).  We split the cheese fries.  But it was an agonizing decision as everything looked tasty.  The pecan waffle was a close second.  The Chef's special omelette, smothered in a bowl of chili, is not for the faint of appetite.  Prepare to stand in line, then scope out what others are having while finishing your wait indoors.  From downtown, get there on historic St. Charles streetcar through the picturesque Garden District.  You won't regret the wait.   We're definitely coming back next time in town....."
515,7uOB23l1EWY9Ma4cdm2iHw,Breakfast was simply divine! I had the best bacon omelette! My husband had a vegetable omelette and pancakes. Simply divine! My stomach was so happy and so was I. The staff is great! Atmosphere is great! And you already know the food was great!
516,FxzU4RfOlKIUzSvcKCN-5w,"I give this 4.49 stars.  You go here for two reasons: you crave that greasy, lets-stop-the-blood-flow diner food, and for the atmosphere.  The chefs are all very fun and entertaining, offering fist punches and the latest dance moves.  I like to get the chef's special, a HUGE omelette that has one of everything in it.  I always take visitors here, for me it is part of the new orleans experience.  I have yet to get sick after eating here, but I know some people do (it is, after all, very greasy food).  But even if you do, that's just a reminder of the good times, right?

Prices - it's a bit more expensive than what diner food should cost, but depending on what you get you can fill up for $10.

Note- sometimes add odd/late hours, the chefs are more 'normal', or not as fun.  If you want the full experience you need to go for lunch or dinner."
517,KKCalZm6vaXfrS6fovRLnA,"A visit to New Orleans is just not complete without a breakfast at the Camellia Grill.  Thankfully everything has remained much as I remember it from  40 years of dining here.  Nothing fancy about the food, just well done diner food.   Never had an omelet here that wasn't perfect.  The chocolate freeze is a regular for me for breakfast always.  Nothing more decadent than a milkshake concoction for breakfast along with coffee.   The attentive waiters, marble countertops, cloth napkins, real plates and silverware make this a diner in a class by itself.  May the Camellia Grill remain timeless in New Orleans."
518,udTgxtB-e7V9Y5DIK4ANFg,"This is no longer the Camellia Grill that Harry and Marvin made famous and kept you coming back for more!

Wish I could give 5 starts...patron for 40+ years. 

2 adults 3 kids. Wife had roast beef with debris, came out as ordered and was A+. Kids and I have burgers and very good cooked as ordered. Issue was the amount of grease dripping off the burger (enough for us to practically fill a mason jar). 

Pains me to write anything negative about this institution, but it needs to be cleaned up. Cooks are not using gear to protect their hair from falling into food nor are gloves present. I watched as he added a patty to the grill then made a turkey sandwich without washing his hands 1st. 

Placed a to go order and instead of sitting at the counter to wait, gave us the bill and asked us to go wait by cashier. Was not busy and had 15 open seats...what was the rush?"
519,7_07qk5DjyD-R_5t3P-EKg,"The food is awesome, and the atmosphere is very lively! Everyone is friendly (save the hostess). I had the western omelet with cheese both times, and also had pancakes the second. I will say that the omelet ingredients are finely chopped, and that is a little different than most places. Marvin is very entertaining!"
520,sJQc3ufoiMdDC8ZZAvHkxQ,"I wish I'd found this place earlier in our vacation, because we ate at several overpriced, mediocre places in the French Quarter. But The Grill (formerly, The Camellia Grill) is everything those places weren't. It's tasty, reasonably prices, and clean. It's all counter seating, so it has a cool vibe, and the service was amazing. It's not where you want to go for fine dining, but it's perfect for breakfast and lunch!"
521,In44348lu1LAYoQRcG93Yg,"OMG - I will cut to the chase.  Do not eat there.  My husband and I went to Camellia Grill on Carrollton at 5:30 pm Sat the 12th.  I ate a Ruben Sandwich and my husband a Roast Beef Sandwich and we shared onion rings.  We arrived home around 7:00 and by 8:00pm I was hugging a toilet.  AND NO IT WAS NOT ALCOHOL RELATED. I was so sick.  Today is Monday and feeling a little better.  My husband is a doctor so he immediately said Food Poisoning.  The place was not very clean and many flies.
The guy who waited on us wiped off the space where the grill is located and then wiped the counter.  How nasty.
All I can say is for everyone to be aware of the surroundings where you eat.  One person may not see the same things as another.  Flies in a restaurant are not clean.

BEWARE - BE CAREFUL - BE Smart"
522,Z68_ACIbIWTn2G766qC6-w,Good food and very entertaining servers! Fun place for people watching!
523,Mo17_W7CPNw32lRfVZbkgQ,"First ate here in 1986 and it has changed very little. That's a great thing in this case. This place is a blast from the past and a New Orleans institution. Gets super crowded on weekends so plan accordingly. All seats are at the counter so you get a good view of the grillmen at work. Eggs are always cooked exactly to order. Pancakes are fluffy. Just about everything is good, but they really shine on omelettes. My favorite is the corned beef hash omelette: huge, non-greasy, and made with the best corned beef hash I have had in ages. Burgers are tasty

The staff is friendly, cheerful and works hard to keep diners happy. Take your bill to the cashier by the door when ready to go. Parking can be a challenge so you might have to hike a bit."
524,nSta4PVEOXY2IMb7sq2Edw,"I wasn't very impressed, as soon as I walked in their was a odd smell, you can see the kitchen and it was clean at all, and I also didn't see people who were handling raw meat wash their hands afterward."
525,vNj-gDlAAwNcgaRS0RWGKA,"My wife has been telling me about this place for years... says you can't get the 'real' NOLA experience without it.  Listening to her rant about their pecan waffles made it seem like too much.  But...

We finally got in there for breakfast on the morning of Christmas Eve.  They were... packed.  I hadn't realized the place is an old-time diner - with a sinuous counter and anchored stools.  But that's what it is.

The staff is... amazing.  Our waiter put a ticket in front of each patron, and proceeded to record their orders.  Once filled, he called them out - in order - to the cook, who started cranking out the orders in a mass-production frenzy.  The motion behind the counter was intense.  I could see the staff sliding across the floor on a layer of grease (butter?) that had slopped while cooking, but clearly something they were accustomed to.  They were MOVING!  
The orders came up promptly and accurately.  The food was HUGE.  (Don't bother coming if you're just feeling peckish... wait until you are ready to EAT.)

My wife's waffle was outstanding.  My omelet (the Manhattan) was delicious, but too big to finish.  Even the coffee, with chicory, was really good.

All the time we were eating, though, we couldn't take our eyes off of the choreographed ballet going on behind the counter.  These guys are all pros, and they act like it.

Go to the Camellia Grill.  You owe it to yourself."
526,Z4Eia0vvCk1JPC-HEhQRFQ,"What a great local breakfast spot! The omelets are bar far the best choice when eating at this classic diner. Show up early, but if you have to wait, it's worth it. This local tradition comes with plenty of history and Nawlins flair. The wait staff are very engaged in the foodie experience. You won't be disappointed an you definitely won't walk away feeling you didn't get a hearty and fulfilling breakfast."
527,TNydHqglDMBZ4oQgHy7k0Q,Delicious and inexpensive! I only wish they had actual table seating so you don't have to rush out.
528,dkRLoOlcVnWYuMGDb59SLg,"Loved this spot. Great diner experience: good food and attentive service. Though busy, it was a bit more relaxed than the French Quarter location. Will definitely come back if/when in town again."
529,5CtuxCORiCFEo4UtO8oF8A,"Had to go to this place. It's one long, winding counter. So if you don't like to eat at the counter, don't eat here - there is no other option.  The one (and only) drawback is the wait to be seated, but that's normal for such a popular spot. There are tons of food choices on the menu. Everything you can think of for breakfast, brunch, and lunch. I guess they must do a killer dinner business too, but it seems like a breakfast/lunch place to me.  We were there for brunch. I got red beans and rice with a sausage patty. Not the best I've ever had, but good nevertheless. I don't remember what the others in my party got, but I know they all enjoyed their food as well. 
There was a birthday girl with us, and the waiter gave here a complimentary bloody Mary, and gave the rest of us mimosas (yes - gave).  
The best thing about this place is the staff.  They sho do make the place lively, yelling back and forth to each other, and sometimes messing with the customers in a playful way. 
Bottom line:  four meals, sodas, and a cocktail each, all for $29. 
A fun place to eat  You can't beat it."
530,d85s2O9wzIJm2-6ibW7oPw,"Really a great diner with classic fast and friendly service. Only counter spaces, but you get to watch the action at the grill. Large omelettes and excellent tea. Very reasonable and right off the St Charles street car line"
531,lr0u2UVzV-DX1IKonsaFLw,"I went to this counter-service-only spot on a night in which there was a little bit o' drama:  the main cook's car was hit while it was parked.  He still knocked my Bacon Cheeseburger out of the park, even while venting about the situation & taking trips outside to observe the situation.  Everything was being settled with the boys in blue when I left, so all was well in the end.

Everyone at this place works hard & gives great service.  The burgers aren't bad, either!"
532,c_DySNtpIwOeNuH3yPQdMA,"I can't explain how much I love this place other than saying they understand when I want something ""on the split,"" and I could sing with friends at the counter at 2 in the morning.

Some of my best memories are from Camellia Grill!

Oh yeah, the omelets, the burgers, the shakes, and of course the chocolate pecan pie warmed on the grill.... heaven."
533,xM2KMPhnCeSVeRRw-OvE0Q,Delicious and fun. Great place to get breakfast food/burgers anytime of the day. Atmosphere is great but seating is kind of funky.
534,ucrQCt3TSjBEMjfgxDn-OQ,"This is a fun place to eat.  limited menu but great food, and watching the way everthing is prepared right in front of you is an experience, (think bennehanna only breakfast ) The service is great , and the staff is extremely personable.  I highly recommend eating here though they do not take reservations and it can be a long wait."
535,8FYqnXcvooNowSXwWtiPyw,"Loved it! Based on other reviews that I read, I was afraid we would be missing out on the delicious local food and having to suffer through a hamburger and french fries meal. Fortunately I was mistaken we had a delicious bowl of gumbo and a fantastic muffaletta sandwich. Other folks were having great looking hamburgers and If I could go back for one, I would. Service was great (thanks Marvin) and it was a great meal. 

I say take the trolley car out St Charles Ave and eat there!"
536,Q4paCItxn0CzoUyeOs3LIg,"Okay, there is always a line outside of here and I have no idea why. I ordered a burger and it was small and shitty tasting. My friend got a sandwich and hated it also. The only appeal to me is that American Horror Story's Freak Show filmed their diner scenes in here. Service was good. Food was awful."
537,gPjck3c3usilAyRURZoXqg,"It was a good meal overall. The server forgot to give me the waffle multiple times, so we simply got it taken off our bill. The hash browns and omelet both tasted good and it is nice to watch them cook your order. 

It is a very tiny diner that can get very crowded very quickly. When we walked in, there was only one other group eating and by the time we were leaving the place was nearly full. 

Overall, it is a good diner, I simply wish it was open 24 hours."
538,tGTpiEMSLgqydZAUOB6Mnw,"By far one of the best places I have ever been to eat! Not only was the food good but the service was outstanding and hilarious!! The po boys are great if you're hungry and the omelette looked awesome as well. Frank is one of the best servers I've ever encountered! They sang to us, and helped cure my hangover! The atmosphere was just right! Also loved the ice cubes they were very cold but not too cold!"
539,cpr9UE1btb0daFVPfXsRFg,"Love it!  This has been a regular dive for me for more than 10 years, and for good reason:  The Cherry Chocolate Freeze.  Oh my... a blend of icecream and milk and chocolate syrup and crushed maraschino cherries... it's the best thing you can do for yourself on a hot NOLA day.  I love their burgers, I love their sandwiches, and their massive omelettes are a brilliant hangover cure.  Even their waffles are fantastic... thin and crispy, not Belgian, but unbelievably good with the pitcher of melted butter they'll have for you.  Their homemade pies are delicious as well.

On a great day, you'll find the cooks to be more entertaining than anything else around.  I always think of Camellia Grill as ""dinner and a show""... I've heard so many hilarious jokes (though not all of them were child-friendly) and seen spatula and egg juggling, tossing items on the grill from across the restaurant, and other such antics that keep me in stitches throughout my meal.

The only things keeping this from being a 5 star review are 1) the inevitably long wait, as there are few seats and no outdoor seating available, and 2) the prices are deceptively low on the menu... the burger is cheap, but they charge for it to be dressed, relatively high cost for a slice of cheese, fries are a la carte, so it can surprise you when you get your total.  Still a decent value, but I do wish I didn't have to do so much math when ordering!  Worth every penny, though."
540,5Ofop26sMcmVNP9zn0SaBg,"Ambiance here is old school, but cool.

Grilled cheese...amazing!

I liked how the head chef (you'll know who he is when you hear him) was assertive with the staff in order to get the food out as quick as possible and I also liked his sense of humor with everyone. He picked on us for coming in from Houston, but he meant it with love! I could tell he was passionate about what he does as well as how much he cares about the restaurant. He surprised me with complimentary pancakes, but I was so stuffed at that point that I couldn't finish it! Those were amazing as well!

This place will be around for many years to come."
541,AornmvZ7T6ciiOTpTqhBiw,"Every time someone from out of town asks me where they should go eat, I send them to Camellia Grill.  I don't think you can get a piece of pie that good (and greasy) anywhere else.  Everything is freshly made and made right in front of you.  Belly up to the bar and sit on an original bar stool.  I don't think there is anything on the menu that is not good.  Get a freeze, a burger and a piece of pie and you'll be set.  Chat with the person sitting next to you and the waiter.  The waiters seem to have their own language and love to spontaneously start singing and get everyone involved.  It is easy to get to (there is a street car stop right in front) or take a cab.  You cannot miss eating at the location that can boast it has a song written after it's burgers.  Ever heard of ""Cheeseburger in Paradise"" by Jimmy Buffet?  Yeah, that's about a Camellia Grill Burger.  You never know who might turn up to eat in there: Drew Brees, Reggie Bush, Brad Pitt or Nicholas Cage."
542,V4UKJe75B_0LcqwYHfSciA,"awesome CHEAP food, great surface, and neat seating area (three U-shaped bar-style seating). 

this was my last meal in new orleans and glad it was. it has everything i want in a restaurant. solid food, good service, homey, cozy, easy-going. thank you new orleans."
543,NwlNhgbkebgR410Gz5AkRg,"This was my last stop of my New Orleans trip and my friends said it was a must! This location has been around for decades and some of the servers have been there just as long. It has a rich history in the community. 

They serve breakfast and lunch. I got eggs sunny side up, hash browns and bacon and good grief was it good. Service was quick. My only complaint was my friend got the wrong burger twice. 

I highly recommend the frosty type drinks. I got a chocolate and it was the best thing I had that day. I ended up trip with the purchase of a Camellia Grille T-shirt."
544,x4rlm5hq_lg-5plLkQ0WGw,The best old school dinner in town. There breakfast is a stable in the city! Worth the wait. The staff is great always friendly with the kids and family's. Must stop on New Orleans! Personal favorite is the potato and cheese omelet with any shake.
545,4xX2TKVJOxhXcXUkMxjsAg,"Always great service and food each time I go to eat here. I love that they're open late and in a pretty convenient location. Next time your in New Orleans by the river, make sure to check them out!"
546,AkLQgxO0Wl8QECMWT0n9TA,The chilli egg white omelette was okay. The omelette was plain and the chilli gave it the only flavor it had. It could have been better.
547,BQ-eEYd8uz13ub3MxVboCQ,"Camellia Grill has always been a New Orleans eating experience not to be missed.
Best comfort food around - try the chili-cheese omelet with hash browns.
My only complaint is the current smartphone invasion - I constantly had at least one waiter standing in front of me, behind the counter, with his neck craned over & furiously texting away.
At one point, there were three of them huddled around. 
Dudes - you're on the job. Wipe a table or something. 
Or try talking with a real live human customer."
548,k5k484fTIYYbciJw1T4WNg,"Amazing food, amazing service. I am from Los Angeles, and this cozy cafe was reccomended to us from a cab driver in the french quarter. Do not miss out on the best hotcakes in town!"
549,41a_6zYfjVso2NuvnFHFZA,"There is no place better after a long night of drinking or after you have slept it off and want a lazy morning mid week breakfast.  It's better if you go during ""off times"" the omelets and burgers are great, shakes are even better.. I'm glad to see this place come back after the storm and they kept that same original feel"
550,Ca57L3A2x4-8HLz6Q1VQgw,"The Camellia Grill is a greasy spoon retro diner. No frills, no fuss.

A plate of their eggs, bacon and hashbrowns may be just the cure you need after a night out in the French Quarter.

You wanna avoid peak dining times - there are no tables, just a counter that wraps around the whole space, and always a line. If you're in a big party, its a good idea to agree to be separated.

They keep a huge plastic jug of liquid butter right by the grill - and im not sure that there was any one dish that didnt get doused. But its fun to watch, and although you should probably buy shares in lipitor, it really makes everything taste better.

The main reason you need to come here is the Pecan Pie. BEST. PIE. OF. MY. LIFE. ever. 

The crust is super thin, nearly like filo pastry, and the filling is the perfect blend of sweet, gooey goodness and pecans with just a hint of salt. The magic comes when they put it on the grill. Yes - they warm your pie (top down to start) on the grill, which is why it makes it even more important to order it a la mode. Some kind of awesome alchemy happens where the pie picks up just a hint of the delicious salty flavour of whatever has preceded it on the grill.

It was epic. I will hold the dessert memory dear until I can get back for another slice of heaven."
551,XWbICZmCbEeNwp2OaDaQqA,"Was here during Jazz Fest 2009.  This place is awesome!  Old style counter seating encourages neighborly conversations while excellent service provides entertainment and efficiency.  ""We'll start with some waters"", I replied.  A server in white shirt and black bow tie exults in twang, 'two glasses of Mississippi coming right up.'  Portions are huge!  I had a buttery burger melt that was juicy and hearty.  A traditional greasy spoon with the warmth of mama's kitchen.  Once you walk in, you're immediately part of the family. This home is where the heart is."
552,cMVZTqLgjM9M7sZ8ulboIw,"I imagine this is what real 'old school American' diners are like.
Super friendly servers!
Great to be able to see the grill right there.
Amazing decor.

Come early, it's rather tiny and you may find yourself waiting for ages!"
553,wmTNdWzQZXxF6kNAJeGiVA,"I love me some Camellia Grill.

If you go on a weekend, you are most likely going to find a huge line out the door. The reason is: Deliciousness.
Don't get discouraged, the place is small but the line moves pretty fast.

My favorite part about Camellia is that the cooks/waiters are AWESOME. Seriously, super friendly, treat you like you are their buddy. Leon is my fave.

I ordered some eggs, hash browns and toast. Well, eggs are eggs, they don't change much from place to place, but the hash browns were crispy on the outside/soft on the inside, just the way I like them. 

My husband ordered the pancakes, and although they didn't sound like a good idea at the time we ordered, once I saw them and saw his reaction when he tried them, I had to have them.
He was a sweetie and shared them with me, but there were so good that I WANTED MORE! I WANTED THEM ALL!! HAHAHAHA (evil laugh)

I was seriously hoping we wouldn't finish them, but I was a fool! A FOOL! He cleaned that plate, and if it was socially acceptable to lick it, he would have.

Take my advice: Don't be a fool. Order the pancakes."
554,bytnAOrWOD3q-xfK2XulgQ,"Uptown, how I love you! This location is setup just like the restaurant in the Quarter. The service was amazing(and entertaining), of course. 
The food was not as good as in the Quarter, but it was delicious and a mighty fine breakfast.
A beautiful neighborhood and a NoLa staple."
555,sF9uAmgbyPsD0noVocBTnA,"Damn good breakfast, simple as that. And you get to sit at a counter, how cool, right?
YEP, you're gonna be waiting a while for a seat on a Saturday morning, but isn't that a good sign?
Our server Marvin was entertaining enough, but coupled with a great plate of food, I can say nothing bad. 
I had the Manhattan omelet, if anyone's interested, but everything else looked awesome as well. Try the chocolate freeze, it won't be soon forgotten."
556,SNctaqj-I1oiav_Xx8CX7g,"Wowza - Wonderful! Traditional breakfast - super nice wait staff. Quick, affordable and delicious. Thanks : )"
557,2EZqmUauW8qx6jBUGfcjIg,"We ate breakfast at the Garden District location in January.  I must give the 5 star rating, since my husband is STILL talking about the omelet a month later.

There were 4 of us starting  our sight seeing day with breakfast at the Camellia Grill.  They did not disappoint.  We were able to sit indoors while we waited for 4 adjoining seats to open up.  NOTE - be prepared to wait.  The time passed quickly as we were able to see the two grill cooks, hear the banter, and see all the delicious food being served.

This is simple food done right! It is the real deal.  I had a egg/bacon/lettuce/tomato poor boy which was excellent.  We were all intrigued by the liquid butter that was on the counter too!

Take the time and find your way to the Camellia Grill"
558,cFRIZUqhAk9Pty-wDPeS8w,This place was charming and delicious. Had an omelet and pecan waffle for breakfast- really enjoyed both! The staff was excellent as well. Hoping to go back for another meal- would definitely recommend!
559,v1HGc_skoftWChl1D0Eyfg,"This place is a landmark, which is why you will have to wait in a ridiculous line during prime hours.  The food is good, but it's not going to blow your mind.  You come here for the experience, and it's an experience best had at 10pm when the crowds have receded, and the interactions are more personal."
560,altmXayuUxDnBNnw4egBcw,Love love love this place! Found through yelp when visiting for the New Orleans Jazz Festival and ended up eating breakfast here the rest of the time. The service was awesome! Love those guys;) and the food was excellent can't wait to go back- the waffles were my fav! Good coffee!
561,NJhrYRCvpfUSVqXKcmXdKw,Went their this morning and last night. Best chocolate freeze the best and the waitors are the coolest!
562,hpFKF0wLNvxW9F5MbbrAjg,"We simply had to go here. It's an institution - or so they say. Turns out it was recently re-opened post Katrina with new owners and the same diner decor with counter seating and same heart attack inducing menu. (Chili cheese fries, shakes, omelettes with chili in them served with sides of french fries, bacon cheeseburgers).   

The waitstaff and cooks here sing (literally sing) with joy while they're taking care of you. There's always a line outside and as with many of the lines at New Orleans institutions, I'm not really sure it's worth waiting for. But maybe that's the yankee in me who doesn't like to wait for anything...ever. 

You will smell like Camelia Grill all day, if you eat here. Even after a shower, I think."
563,vwqIel2pdj8kUftbEEtnKg,"Went to Camellia Grill for the first time last week since August 2005 (a few weeks before that bitch Katrina tried to take out NOLA.

Best for Late Night after a night out in Uptown.

Camellia Grill is one of those New Orleans institutions that's off the main tourist path.  Lines like I remembered but definitely worth the wait.  This was one of those places that New Orleanians thought Katrina TKOed for good...but the Camellia Grill following signed petitions and did everything they could to revive Camellia Grill.  Thankfully, they decided to reopen after originally deciding not to in the aftermath of the hurricane.  If you went to grammar school in NOLA/Metarie/Kenner this was definitely a place you hungout on your nights out.

Service is top notch.  There is always that certain New Orleans flair you get from the waiters that makes the place popular among the uptown locals and tourists.  It is what Southern hospitality is all about.

Food is your typical breakfast/diner food, but the main difference is there is that certain lovin' everyone puts in making this place standout from a Waffle House/Denny's/IHOP.  Best yet....they use Blue Bell ice cream products.  You haven't had real ice cream until you've had Blue Bell....that extra ounce of trans fat is what it is all about.

Long live this NOLA institution."
564,8v4oZIY51g_59NmkfZNgxQ,"We took the St. Charles street car down here since it was highly recommended by family. I had pecan pancakes and the hubs had an omelette with chili on top. My pancakes were good but I thought the omelette was a bit salty. People were friendly, but we didn't get any daps from the waiter! I was looking forward to it, too. Cleanliness was a bit questionable."
565,Q7SGfyzDar0D7XPylDBlcA,"First time visiting and this place was awesome! It's a very laid back homey feeling place. Our waiter was exceptional and the food was A-MAZING! I had the Chef's Omelette and I started to lick the plate, but realized I was in public! Definitely would recommend!"
566,wR5MoZcJo2oMdTM_XcvyUw,this place is AWESOME!! the service is great. and the chili cheese fries are gooey yummy mess. love it. service was quick too.
567,PSP1bTxY1YgyVIsRKlTqdQ,"The fluffiest, most amazing omelette i have ever had. Got it with bacon and cheese and it was phenomenal. Service was friendly as and fast as can be. My wife got a waffle and hash browns. She devoured them like it was first time having them. We will definitely be returning many, many times."
568,1nF3jiuwYgpQZgP6hh3nng,"I want to give this joint a fourth star just based on theatrics and service but I'm hard pressed considering the food. It's an uneven mix of wow, that's amazing and, eh, not that interesting. 

Here's the all out star: The Catfish Sandwich ""fully dressed"" What does fully dressed mean? Smothered in chili. That's right, I didn't think it was possible or even palatable, but a fried catfish sandwich on a hoagie drenched in chili is a few bites of lead heaven in your belly. 

The burger, well disappointing. I had the fully dressed burger which has a nice touch, they take the meat patty and squish it on the grill flattening it out into a thinner wider patty which creates more surface area and a crispy exterior texture. However, a rockin, sockin burger this does not make, just a crispy patty. I think you can get ""regular"" style burgers with bacon and cheese which looked awesome but considering the meat wasn't a nail biting piece of steer I'm not sure they would be any better.

We were looking forward to the pecan pancakes but sadly they were just ok, nothing that rocked our world. Maybe it's because the wait was well over an hour and thankfully it wasn't in a true southern heat, we were just expecting more. 

What is a treat is the service, the litany recited for each order and the overall mirth that seems to take place, fake or not, behind the serpentine counter, now that's good fun. Oh yeah, you get greeted and thanked at the end with a fist bump. Priceless."
569,5ubvBeI0FqRo-kFI47Xe0A,"Went here yesterday and had a very delicious and exciting time.

One of the best places for breakfast in New Orleans - straight diner style, that's how I like it...  

I think during the week you can pretty much walk in here with no / minimal wait...

During the weekends (when I've driven by many times) there are extremely long lines.

I enjoyed the breakfast very much.  Also, they cook the bacon really good too.  I like it extra crispy, not chewy, and that's how it came...

Eggs/bacon/sausage/grits/hash browns/waffles...  all good.

Look forward toward re-attending."
570,_JJbq_RP-Wt7L5UbCxxZRw,"This place is right out of the 50's or 60's which makes it nostalgic.  The wait staff were hurried but friendly...wearing the really old school, before my time, uniforms.  All the seating is at an old school counter, which is interesting.  The restroom, at least venturing there, is a ""real trip"".  We had to wait since it was crowed, but eventually managed.  
Most of the food consists of breakfast and brunch treats.  I had an mushroom omelet which was just ok.  Interesting enough, the person taking your order also cooks your order.  
Also, since its a really old place, don't expect spick and span...then you wont be disappointed."
571,JH4_Y4tstgYM4IcOSx8qGg,"If you aren't from here, you might wonder what the fuss is about. It's just a lunch counter, right? With long benches for folks waiting for a seat at the counter. Your first clue should be that those benches are usually full and the line is out the door. And the line is mostly locals. Locals from a town known for its food. Yes, it's diner grub. Yes, it's really that good. I get either the Rubin or the Doc Brinker Special with a mocha freeze."
572,Df6nNyUcno1qrMScii2cPg,"Leon was our server and he was great, making jokes and treating the ladies like ladies! Great southern feel with a sit up bar. All the cooks and wait staff were out in the open and communicating by shouting back and forth and making jokes at the same time. The food was great, it came out really fast and we all left satisfied. I had the bacon omelette which was full of cheese. Waffle was great too"
573,kYfTXk6dIDW6yx198OdEQA,"Our friends Joey and Droze introduced us to the Camellia Grill on our first visit to New Orleans six or seven years ago.  We had a great meal and made sure to go back on our second trip to New Orleans.  I had a waffle and it was great!  Others in our group had an omelette and a burger.  I tasted the omelette and it was good, too...and my friend Mike said the burger was amazing (and it looked amazing).  Counter seating only...which is different and fun.  Loved the camaraderie between the cooks and servers -- fun and entertaining.  We rode the St. Charles street car from Canal Street to Camellia Grill and back (love the street cars!)  As soon as the street car line makes a 90 degree turn to the right, get off and you will be ready to line up for a great meal.  This place is an institution and will always be high on my list for future visits to New Orleans!"
574,NmYPqahRjviFJTdvupImYw,"This small place is run by a small crew of guys in bow ties who have their operation down to a T.  Got our ""freeze"" (dense, tasty milkshake) first and then our huge, pillowy omelette and bacon cheeseburger not too much longer later.  The perfect amount of portions to be full, but not need leftovers, and at pretty cheap prices.  The only knock I have on this place is the weird bathroom situation in the back of the kitchen."
575,GANyehO5V8M1qo7ozFs0uw,Stopped in after the Saints absolutely dominated the Eagles. Got a burger and a chocolate freezie. Paired perfectly and tasted amazing! Definitely gotta stop by again.
576,IvTmLC1RYmPTnlFHteAKbA,"This is a really cute diner with a family friendly feel. According to a regular, all of the workers there have been there for 15+ years. They're just a joy to be around, always smiling and making jokes. Sometimes they even sing! It's pretty tiny and every one sits at the bar but it's a good time. Maybe just not so good for a big group. I hear the omelets are phenomenal. They even have turkey bacon! Oh and it is soooooo cheap. Definitely a nice place if you want to feel welcome :)."
577,gscgU6CoQlYcQt8BwiamfQ,Great filling flavorful food served by great gentlemen in bow ties and prepared by very personable grillmasters. I enjoyed red beans and rice and pecan pie at their old fashioned Southern counter. A highlight of my New Orleans visit
578,P4Ij5P_L7aaGAeVZ6GzoBA,"One of my favorite places to have breakfats in NOLA! Chef omelete minus the chili with buttered toast. Huge portion and the best thing to help with a hangover! Grub on the food and then head down and get a grenade...no better way to start your morning. 

Note** It is small and seats are limited so get there early!"
579,RPOni1gqyKcLL9XLgUBBKA,"Quality of service and menu items has taken a step backwards from past experiences. I have eaten here for over 40 years and it has changed for the worse. The hamburger and fries are still up to par but other items were not on a recent Saturday evening. The Reuben sandwich was thin and the corned beef was subpar. The pecan waffle was thin, dry and nothing like I had previously. I saw pancakes served that were burnt and should never be served. The waiter did not get our drinks served on time for the meal and inferential he seemed unable to handle the customers."
580,AQLeagVdghNIkH_B5gbObw,Food is great especially when you are a tad drunk.  Milkshake was terrible.  Overall though I'd come back and hope they fix the milkshake maker thingy.

Jerell even picked up my daughter's tab after accidentally knocking over a glass of ice water onto Her lap.  Definitely worth the drive to this side."

584,V9zHaxsbhqB0cN3s7pQfNQ,"BURGERSBURGERSBURGERS. I am really surprised by the one start reviews. This is not a tourist trap! It's a cheap eat that's entertaining and decent. They use fresh food for pretty much everything, and the grilled onion burgers are great. The freezes are a must. The service is whacky and most of the delight of coming here: the grill is right in front of you behind this W shaped bar that slivers around the restaurant. The chefs and waiters speak in some shortened lingo to send out orders quick and have keywords like ""911 this stuff is hot and ready to go! EMERGEN-C get them burgahs on tha grill!"" etc. A must visit!"
585,0Iqj5zNc75JLn5Zloe2Rqw,The food was great though not expensive but the atmosphere and service made it worth the wait.  Definitely would recommend this spot for lunch or breakfast.

587,7sAmP0lXuvvjcbpEHxZOjA,"My five stars are granted on the basis of two excellent menu items not on most people's lists:   banana cream pie and cole slaw.

The banana cream pie is traditional with deep banana flavor that gives no hint of artificial flavor, borne out visually by dark splotches and even a few visible banana seeds.  The top is pure whipped cream (that's real butterfatty cream, not topping.  It's so good I sometimes pop a dollop in my coffee).  The crust is both rich and flaky, which probably means it's yielding the same result in my arteries.  I don't care; this is the best banana pie I've ever had.  I especially recommend this pie for purists, as there are no novel new distractions like chocolate or caramel to compete with the banana manna.

The cole slaw started as my nod toward making a healthy choice in meals otherwise laden with lethal luxuries (including said banana cream pie).  But over time, I've grown fond of the slaw on its own merit: always fresh and cold with the flavor and texture favoring cabbage over mayonnaise.   

On everything else, four to five stars. The burgers are in the same vein (are my coronary concerns about this place that obvious?)  as Steak and Shake, but somehow Camellia Grill burgers simply have more flavor, especially if you ask for Creole mustard.    French fries are large, crispy, and delivered directly from the fryer to your spot at the counter.  The omelets are the fluffiest I've experienced."
588,wdXUR7KRYtp4qM3y5EroPw,"Best meal ever in New Orleans.

The boyfriend and I took the street car and saw a line of people outside of this place and thought: 1) a line outside a restaurant is a good sign, 2) this wasn't the French Quarter so it didn't seem like a tourist trap, 3) those didn't look like tourists since no one had a camera with them.  We decided to hop off the trolly and make our way in line too.

I was pretty hungry and wasn't sure what we were waiting in line for so I went up to look at the menu.  I came back to the boyfriend and said ""looks like sandwiches, burgers, eggs, nothing special.""  And then someone opened the door and I could smell the food.  Ok, SOMETHING was smelling pretty good.  After about 45 minutes waiting, we got seated inside.  This place doesn't have regular tables, it's just a W shaped counter. Each section (left, middle, right) has a counter manager.  You sit down and you tell the counter manager what you want and he just starts yelling the order out.  Behind the counters are 3 grills, each responding to its own section.  Nothing was ever written down, just lots of yelling, but somehow they all heard each other and communicated so well that it ran so smoothly.

I ordered the french dip.  It was the moistest french dip I'd ever tasted in my life.  Usually the meat is all dry and you dip it to make it moist.  I didn't even need to use my dip, it was so great.  Alas though, the boyfriend won the restaurant ordering war this time.  He ordered the Chef's Special Omelette.  We saw them making it and it was a piece of art.  First they cook the bacon, and then the turkey and everything else that goes inside of it, then they add the eggs, so it's just cooking on top of the spot that the bacon and all the other yummy stuff were cooking (this is no place for vegetarians!).  It got scooped up and put on plate, great right?  Wait...they add fries.  Sweet, we thought.  Oh wait, where is he taking the plate?  He's not heading to the counter, omg, he's pouring something on top of the omelette & fries....CHILI!  OMG!  The counter manager plopped that in front of the boyfriend and our jaws just dropped.  Omelette filled with bacon/turkey/cheese, side of fries, all topped with chili?!?!  WINNER!

After we scarfed the food down, what does the counter manager do? He gives the boyfriend a fist bump for finishing his omelette.  Where else are you going to get a fist bump while eating a chili topped omelette?  I scoff at myself for my fool-hardy comment that the menu didn't look like anything special. The moment the boyfriend and I walked out of this restaurant we both turned to each other and said ""we have to come back to New Orleans again.""  I think the fist bump sealed the deal for us."
589,r9vAiowgUVBTLUj_p-SQwQ,I went here after a local friend referred me. I guess its a local staple so its OK to visit but if your expecting amazing food or burger especially you may be mildly disappointed.
590,NsfKe_QLu3I4mhIMI01CDQ,"Just...wow...Went for lunchfast and totally worth it.  They say there's usually a long wait but during the week its very managable, and def. worth the wait either way.  They only have limited counter seating, but do yourself a favor and go.

Had a double burger with a chocolate freeze.  If you ever believe me about ANYTHING I EVER SAY, it's that you must get the freeze.  I don't care what flavor, you're goin in saving 12 bucks, JUST FRIGGIN' DO IT!!!  Also split some chili fries with my homeboy and they were totally worth it.  I can usually put some food down, but this was waaaay too much.  I ended up feeling sick because even though I was stuffed, I had to eat it because it was soo good.  Even at the end when my friend bought the pecan pie and I thought I had no room left, it was still amazing.

That last bite probably put me over the top so the rest of the day I felt like I was 18-months pregnant, but it was worth every bite.  If you visit New Orleans, you have to stop here, no ifs ands or buts.  Hehe, I said buts."
591,mZ6v8wZ3K3OJ56AZjd-Yxw,Good breakfast served up fast by folks who have been doing it forever. Enjoy!
592,GYD9DhMP5jHMt0P3QbGEow,"Whenever we are in town this is the first place we stop. The food is always delicious, the service is more like an experience and the experience couldn't be more New Orleans; fun, friendly and delicious. My favorite spot in the city. If you are there in the morning get the potato onion omelette, it's the best."
593,2egplpGDf2z5NeFUixJr5w,Awesone place.  9 of traveling stopped here.  Dennis treated us all like royalty.  We all had our food within 15 min.  All orders were great.  We'll be back.
594,kZubnS12zPCEu0m89BMnXQ,"This place used to be an iconic greasy spoon great for late night grub when you've been out drinking.  Perhaps some still love it but I cannot get past the filthiness.  The restrooms are in back and you have to pass through several parts of the back kitchen to get to them.  The stench in that kitchen reminded me of an open sewer.  I saw a hotel pan filled with eggs, sitting out on a counter.  The restroom itself was filthy.  I did not want to touch anything.

As for the food, everything was dripping this brownish grease that was pooling on the plate beneath my eggs and bacon.  It is a greasy spoon so grease is expected, just not pools of it all over the plate.  I had already finished my eggs when I saw the improperly stored eggs in the kitchen.  I just hope those are being used for purposes other than fried eggs.

The waitress was pleasant and attentive, I have no complaints about the service."
595,9l59y0z6xYRgMvV0F68Enw,"Leave the prima-donnas at home, this is a divey diner! The servers are ancient as is the décor.  Don't even think of coming here in a wheelchair as there are no counters without permanent seats and the restrooms are a half-flight up in the back where you might get lost.  Had to laugh at the wooden wheelchair ramp up front of the building.  Well prepared very simple food, with a difficult to get second cup of good coffee. Prices are inline with the place."
596,3rNa9RhJk-tAgdndbXoNaA,"The Camellia Grill; this iconic landmark greasy spoon near Tulane has been grilling up burgers and dishing out milkshakes in the city for more than 70 years. 

I came upon this place by suggestion of a family member; they claimed they had some of the tastiest, greasiest, quickest burgers in the city. I can validate that claim. The cheeseburger (medium rare) fully dressed with an egg is absolutely delicious. Its an iconic, old school, hole in the wall diner with great food...'nuff said"
597,3XErn8K4-hC8EFUQrRSN2w,"I order a vegetable omelet tonight.  I did not order a vegetable omelet with cheese.  According to the menu (see attached picture) the omelet comes with cheese.  I was charged two dollars more for cheese.  This post is not about the two dollars.  Dont care about the money.  

Its mainly about the customer service and attitude I had received when checking out.  I physically brought the menu over (see the picture) and pointed out the omelet comes with cheese and i said take a look to the cashier.  They responded i dont need to look im just focused on doing my job.  Well either the menu is printed wrong, the computer system is wrong, or shes not doing her job correctly/ill informed.  But sadly she didnt even look at the menu for what i was trying to show her.  She looked at me like i was an idiot.  I paid the two extra dollars and left because it was late but obviously will not be going back because they are stealing money from their customers.

By the way the customers can see the entire kitchen.  While the kitchen staff and servers were pleasant, they need to brush up on health code regulations.  Numerous issues.  Servers touching food then menus etc without washing hands, using towels for cleaning then same person touching food, etc.  At least put a barricade up so the customers cant see whats going on."

Great little place...reminds me a lot of a waffle house but better.
Late night breakfast is always good. They have a such staff and really good pecan pie that they put on the grill and then top with ice cream after."
600,NolhgtHNtBJ4S4lcfBJu0A,"NOLA has several quaint and historical places to visit for breakfast. However,​ this place is extremely busy. So be prepared to wait in line it seemed​ to be a popular place at any time​ of the day. Once seated the food came quickly, hot, and made to order. Staff was friendly and shared the historical facts about this place. I felt like I was back in time when times were simpler. I felt at home eating at the bar with my family. Food was delicious and coffee was good. I felt there but not there. I ate our food with a smile as I watched how the place ran. If you have time to come in and sit a spell this is the place to do so. I hope when you do you are thrust​ed back in time and enjoy your meal."
601,bmpPgYAZbI0ikTByRTf6aA,"After a long trolley ride, trying to survive a hangover, we arrive at Camellia Grill.

I wasn't up on why this was a hotspot.  No classic cajun style food served here.  And it didn't look like much from outside.  Especially with a ton of elderly in line.  I wasn't sure where my friends were taking me.  After what seemed like an hour wait we finally pile in to find out that we were waiting to sit in the wait section.  Wow!  

While waiting in the wait section, George and I were planning our order.  Some lovely local ladies waiting behind us pointed us in the right direction.  I'm thinking waffles and burgers, but I should of been thinking omeletes and freezes this whole time.  

Sidenote:  Locals are very friendly in NOLA, helping us northerners set our feet right.  These ladies saved this experience and helped earn Camellia Grill a 5 star rating.  Me and George ordered two seperate meals and decided to split and share.  He ordered the Chef's special omelete smothered in chili.  I ordered the cheeseburger fully loaded.  Both of us had freezes as well.  

Burger:  Very tasty, no complaints, but nothing out of this world.
Omelete:  Freaking Ridiculous!!!  That is the tastiest breakfast food I've ever had.  Light, yet loaded with bacon, chili, cheese, and godliness.  Wow!  And the freezes are pretty good too.

Then, we ordered the pecan pie!  Phew!  Must make room!  Again, ridiculous!!!

So go here, survive the wait, order the chef special omelete, a freeze, and get some pecan pie.  You won't be sorry and you'll be begging for more 3 days later when you can move again!

NOLA, didn't know you had it in ya!"
602,tuDC-jEhb78ThfmlcA4R-A,"Classic diner food. Small place, we missed the rush by going around 1:30. Great burger. We enjoyed the St. Charles streetcar to get there. The photos are spot-on, and the ambiance was enjoyable.  Good place for a quick meal."
603,SaHvN5sABVHORemO7Iu4wA,The service here is incredible and the breakfast was amazing. Truely my favorite local place for breakfast.
604,T7ejn_m00_gxbfa4t1_cjA,"One of my favorite breakfast places in all of NOLA. The omelettes are delicious perfectly complimented by their hash browns. And if you're not an omelette person, they also have delicious waffles and pancakes. Camellia grill is the type of restaurant where you struggle to only order one or two things because everything looks so good."
605,jjsLQ84moTywqOIurR2SIg,"Pretty good breakfast, laid back atmosphere, and decent prices too. I just had breakfast here with my wife for the first time ever. I've been wanting to eat here for years, but I have always ended up going somewhere else because of no parking and a VERY long line out the door. Well, today I passed by this morning and they weren't busy at all. So I had the Eggs with ham and grits. And my wife have a vegetable omelette with hash browns. Her hash browns were a tad overcooked but everything else was great. So the food was just average to slightly above average I would say (I have had a LOT worse meals than this, trust me). It was pretty good but I wouldn't call it ""outstanding"". But the old fashioned atmosphere had me feeling like I was transported back in time. So would I go back, yes but only if it's not really busy. As small as that place is and the lines I have seen out the door, you would easily be waiting over an hour for a table. I don't know of very many places that I would stand in line for over 30 minutes let alone an hour, I would get antsy and go somewhere else. 
PROS: Good food, GREAT service ( my waiter was awesome!!) Good atmosphere, Decent prices (I said decent, not GREAT prices), Huge Portions, they make you feel at home
CONS: NO Parking (have to park in a nearby lot or find a spot on the streets), VERY Small so there is not much seating (that's why the line gets so long when they are busy)"
606,gC2rlutqIg7_7Qnzj_90lw,"Comfort food, pure and simple.  You sit on a little stool at a counter, where you are cheerfully greeted by a waiter.  It's all the show from here.  Everything they do , from handing you a straw, polishing your silverware, is with flair.  
The food is just typical diner fare.  I live for the bacon cheese omelet with grits and a pecan waffle.  The omelet  has this fluffy texture that I just can't recreate at home.
Try coming off hours.  It's good, but not wait 30 minutes good.  I usually go around 9/10 in the AM or PM (weekdays) and have never stood in line once.
I promise, you will most likely leave with a smile on your face after experiencing Camellia Grill."
607,68w5_yV8b1S35eCXSKgqpw,"Pros:
Chocolate shakes
Breakfast
Awesome staff
Portion sizes

Cons:
Extremely greasy

Bottom line:
Great old school diner with food that'll be sure to fill you up."
608,sag7ybqz9ek-RS3xi9AqIg,A must stop when visting NOLA. Long line but worth the wait.  Thank you Camellia Grill.  I love New Orleans!
609,ojH2ELSKnv6ri83F4C4s7g,"My big sister came home for Giftmas, and wanted to hit the Camellia Grill. I hadn't been since 2004, and it's nice to see that things haven't changed a bit. We both ordered the chef' special omelet, and hashbrowns. Add a cup of coffee to that, and you've got a great breakfast (at 2:00 pm). 

The staff is funny, friendly, and playful. I enjoyed talking to them, and my sister kept them coming back for jokes. Space is limited so you've to to hurry up and eat, but they give generous portions and have go-boxes for those with small stomachs like me. Anyone who cleans their plates, like big sis, is a champion in my book!"
610,PrNTSENToQ8vGyPAfyP4mQ,"This is the perfect place for breakfast.   We had seven in our party and it was a quick seat.   Michael was our server and he was FANTASTIC (word of the day) (ask Michael).  I had the Mexican omelet and it was great but more than I could eat.  My son had the pancakes and his exact words were ""sweet baby Jesus these are the best pancakes I've ever had"".  The price is great for a home cooked breakfast.   Excellent !!"
611,jTEX9rVeWgH4zIrhMch_XQ,Went again recently - still a great experience.  Place never changes.  The Pecan Pie is not of this dimension.
612,mwM1CG-wS2pFfvM3ayPV7g,"Yep, another 5 star review after my 3 weeks in NOLA. I went here twice in 3 days for the burger. I am fully aware of how many burgers I've eaten in the past 3 weeks, and I don't care. This place is a little slice of old timey fun. You sit at the counter stool next to a total stranger and a server in a white coat comes up to help you. At that point you get the burger...with cheese...and the fries. Most importantly you do not forget to get the chocolate cherry bomb. That's the bestest milkshake on earth. Yum. 
I'm gonna leave it at that, and you should follow what I say....and then you'll be happy. The End."
613,0sv4qHwC2NpwpFTR9G6NnQ,"I have talked so much about this meal, my family is now making fun of me! I will dream of the french fry po' boy until I'm able to return.

Located in the Garden District, it was a nice ride on the trolley from where we stayed in the Warehouse District that provided views of stately mansions, Tulane and Loyola Universities and Audubon Park. Upon entering Camellia, one feels taken back in time to the 50's with seating around a lunch counter and gentlemen dressed in white shirts with black bow ties preparing the food. My friend, a NO native, recommended the french fry po' boy, but I just couldn't imagine how it could be that great, so we decided to each order something and split halves. I ordered the Yankee Special with roast beef, swiss, grilled onions, slaw and mushroom sauce. I thought it was delicious until I tried the french fry po' boy then had major entree envy (which really didn't matter since we each had half, but I would have loved an entire one). The formula is simple: mayo, lettuce, tomato, french fries and roast beef gravy, but the outcome is pure bliss. Make sure you get extra napkins, though, as both sandwiches were full of sauce/gravy and very messy. But, please, don't eat them with a fork. Pick them up and get your hands dirty! 

After completely stuffing ourselves, we hopped off the trolley at Audubon Park for a nice walk to work off some of that Camellia deliciousness. This is a place I will return again and again and again."
614,TR1CCj9dgEgEAWABZ-q08A,"If you starvin', go see Marvin at the Camelia Grill..  Eggs or burgers, he does it right for me.  He always seems to remember me.  Great service..  Great food."
615,E2QOGYwgMA-CZhFER6Ou_w,"Cheeseburger and onion rings were so good, 5 of us enjoyed our meal before our uncomplaining friend received his half-cooked omelet.  Our quiet friend asked for his omelet a bit more cooked, with a little more ham. The cook held his gaze, dumped his plate, and started all over without one word. 
Our local friends were apologetic, we were surprised (he never complained while watching the rest of us eat).

Moral of the story: get what your friends order if you want to eat with them. 
We recommend the cheeseburger and onion rings.

Tip: open late."

617,dP59EJIAaNf-bgBownILPg,"Traditional Americana Diner meets Classic New Orleans

One of the best features here is that it is open late. The first time I came here and basically every other time has been after 10 PM.  And really, that's the perfect time for a diner and grill, if you ask me. This greasy spoon at the River Bend is a big hit and great combo with a late night on the town. 

The only dining options that sick out for me are the desserts. Not because the other items are bad but because of my supreme sweet tooth. They have Bluebell and pies. That's all you need to know. 

I like the servers here too. They're always friendly and very personable."
618,WWeAOhCjuw_h-DigxpCA_A,"This is one of the best diners I've been to, ever. When Guy Fieri frequented The Joint a few years back, I was a bit disappointed to hear that he didn't stop by Camellia as well. Watching Guy and Marvin interact would have been hilarious. Then again, that would have drawn an even larger crowd than usual, which would be no small thing, seeing as Camellia's gets crowded quickly and stays that way for much of the day. There is no pressure to turn tables, so expect to wait 30 minutes at least before getting a seat if you're coming at a time that could be considered lunch hour. Or dinner hour. Or fourth meal hour for that matter. But should you care? No. The prices are great for the portions, and the food is fantastic."
619,lVldNXa_J3gDiQPaEdDrDQ,"Mostly a tourist trap.

Expect LONG lines and a LONG wait if you get there after 9 AM on the weekend (we had to wait about 1 hour).

Getting up early to rush out to breakfast is not a top priority for us. :)

I really enjoyed the atmosphere but the food was not that great (my waffle was burnt)."

It's an iconic place with great food. We usually split an omelette, a pecan waffle, half order of grits & half order of fries. Then we get a Chocolate Freezy to go. All is very delicious. The staff is very friendly. They all wear their traditional white starched waiter coats & serve the utensils in white starched linen napkins.( They used to use the linen napkins, but are now paper.) each waiter  hands you a straw with the top still covered. These traditions are all done while sitting on the bar stools at the counter. Then you can watch the cooks do their magic preparing delicious meals."

This place has so much character from the outside, which looks like a church and the inside with the cool counter and friendly servers. It was like going back in time and really feeling the true spirit of Nola. We absolutely loved the pecan pie. The frozen chocolate was good too, but not to be mistaken with a chocolate shake - it is more like chocolate milk with grinded up ice in it. We will definitely stop in again on our next visit and try breakfast (they serve it all day) and have an omelette because they whip their eggs! Have heard great things!"

Boy o boy the high ratings were spot on for this little restaurant. Not a big place where you can bring a crowd of 12 but perfect for a couple or just you with a few friends. They have a bar stool seating setup which works for its size and allows you too basically see your food being cooked. I had the catfish po boy which was my first po boy but I can't imagine that a po boy can taste much better than the one l had here. Bottom line great po boy!  My wife had the turkey club which she really enjoyed as well. If you are in the Garden district this is a must stop! You won't regret. One last important thing, the service is as good as the food"
625,WIF0iQyUTQQaIgaWcXyNkA,"My wife and I went here for breakfast.  Came across as a touristy kind of place.  It was very crowded, but we were seated in about 15 minutes.  Be aware that the restaurant is set up like an old-time dinner with stools around a counter.

I had traditional bacon, eggs and hash browns, which were good.  My wife had the waffles.  They sucked.  In fact, they were terrible.  The syrup was not even real syrup.  The picture of the waffle here is not a fair representation of the flat waffle (note the single form of the word).

I give Camellia's three-stars but my wife gives it a minus-one star."

At least not true locals who are actually from New Orleans. I've been 2 or 3 times in the last 20 years, usually late at night when drunk. The food is ok. There are better places to eat, obviously, in New Orleans, but the food is decent. It was closed for awhile after Katrina and I wasnt sure if it was going to re-open, but obviously, it did. The food is definitely not worth the wait. If you are a tourist and want to try it for the ""experience"", by all means, go."
629,aCXk8u6djOnLy5H4wspCNA,Great service and food! We ate wonderful omelette for breakfast one day and later had burgers! For dinner! Great prices and service!
630,LvWx2ZtbnQXnjk8zxvFh4w,"An Uptown New Orleans staple. This is a great place to take in your surroundings. You sit at the counter surrounding the cooks/servers, able to see everyone else sitting around you. It's a hilarious mix of families coming from the Saint's games and people slumped over drunk on the counter eating waffles. The place feels like an old timey diner, really cute inside. There's always a wait because it's really popular but the service is pretty fast and friendly. I've gone on many a late night and always been happy with the comfort food they serve up!"
631,Wb_DJzqy1QXWVJtI8li58w,"I have lived in New Orleans for 4 years now. And there are so many different diner places to go to. When you step into this establishment it is like stepping into the past. You are there during the 1940's before screens and computers where the wait staff takes your order, calls it back to the cook and they make it perfectly no matter what specifications you ask for. The food was absolutely phenomenal for diner food. Would recommend to anybody who comes to visit and also anybody who has lived here for years. 5 stars. This place is a must see."
632,uTpQsjejt0YwvpDi1U3pMw,"Interesting place but I wouldn't go back. The bread was delicious, but overall just okay, nothing special. What I didn't like was that no one preparing the food wears gloves. The guy who plated my sandwich wiped his face and proceeded to handle my food, it was disgusting."
633,nEDGSTe60aGBsqFGMmSYXw,"CHOCOLATE FREEZE

NOW.

The food is good but not great, a wee bit overpriced but usually sold to you with flair and if your lucky a song.  A freeze is a hybrid of a milkshake and an icee, and really chills to the core when its the devil's balls outside in august and you really want something with chili on it."
634,fmV7sGx-V_CWOtSw5vFhGQ,"this place doesn't have any actual tables it's just bar seating. So it's not great for a big group but we had 6 and it worked out fine. The waiter was kinda short but he was seemed busy and still got us everything we asked for after a couple attempts to get his attention. I tried the Mac and cheese bites, cheese fries, and dressed cheeseburger. Everything was really good but I liked the Mac and cheese bites more than the fries. Solid burger spot and it was pretty cheap! $30 for 2 burgers, cheese fries, Mac and cheese balls, & drinks. Definitely recommend for a quick dinner or lunch"
635,4uhS4qe8sw-Yk7ST2vG7PQ,Basic breakfast. Big portions. If you get a high five from Marvin then your day is made!
636,9Wi4NTy-Zjhiv9_DVtIRRQ,"When Jimmy Buffet comes to New Orleans, he makes sure to point everyone here to get the oh so famous, ""Cheese Burger in Paradise"", but don't think they are limited to that. They make some incredible omlets and delicous griddled pecan pie (and choclate pecan pie). Beware though. when entering one should be prepared to have one of the greasiest meals of your life (but in a good way)."
637,wslOVrFVaVVfVcfBeg6Nug,"I wrote a review of my experience here (less than a year ago) and it has since been deleted. It was an honest and fair assessment of the food I ordered (rueben sandwich; tough meat and small portions; worst sandwich I've had in the 10yrs I've lived here) and my experience w the staff (underwhelming, inconsiderate, couldnt be bothered to do their job; borderline rude). It took way too long to be acknowledged with a menu and water. Almost walked out too long, but I was craving diner type food. It was also ridiculously overpriced for the food I received. 

I'm not here to fan flames but I am here to offer anecdotal evidence of my experience. I received a message shortly after posting the review from someone claiming to be the owner/manager (can't recall which) and it was a pretty aggressive opening message. I told them I stood by my experience and wouldn't change my review in response to their hostility (my perception anyhow).

If you come here order something easy to make and difficult to mess up. Somehow a rueben sandwich was beyond their scope of expertise. Don't be surprised by the high prices and low quality. Turns out ownership changed hands between the last time I had been there and the recent above experience."
638,VuGAPKqVMAAnxIe1ms1zuw,"Great breakfast diner at the of the street car line catty corner to cooter Browns. Counter service so you can watch them prepare your meal. Maybe the best pecan waffles on the planet. Customer service is unparalleled here in the city. It's a small place so if they are full up folks will wait. It's worth the wait. Corn machu is excellent, well crafted spicy cream corn. They serve an eye opening Coca Cola too."
639,QHJk3a75FI-EJZlHnjlGCg,The restaurant was recommended by a coworker.  Myself and a party of two went to this location on 07/04/2013.  I was not pleased with the pancakes (terrible batter) and the cook burned my egg.  I did sample my lil sisters catfish po boy it was cooked to hard for me.  Maybe it was the person cooking but I was not impressed.  I may try another location but not this one.
640,b9mXKT4KniZ3Y8TH8OXXTg,"Don't be frightened by the long line outside this joint! Go and stand in line, its worth the wait. Make sure you go with an old friend or some great company, you will have plenty of time to chat and catch up while you wait. 

Once we were seated, we were greeted with the most awesome staff I've ever been served by in a breakfast joint. We not only enjoyed our service experience but the food experience was excellent as well. Camellia's omelets are a must order! The eggs are whipped up in one of those milkshake mixers before poured over the griddle. The result is the fluffiest omelets I've ever had! 

Side note, I thought it was interesting that they make omelets with milkshake mixers and milkshakes with a blender."
641,dg5qqujFhotWOa0sivpKXg,"Totally awesome- very cheerful waiters-  made me smile a lot with the graceful movement.

Got a hamburger with fries, from the diner-style menu.  

Their pecan pie.. YUMMY!"
642,zm4EdY1c5w4NCUaj0fR6OA,"This is a must try if you want that late night diner experience. Parking is a bit crazy but once you get in, you'll have a great time. If you freak out when people are within your personal space you shouldn't even step foot here. Its the really low diner stools and limited space in between them. I think its fun and when your tipsy its even better. I always have breakfast here. Pretty fresh and worth the cost. Planning on taking my husband here soon for his first time."
643,YaufGCUgyp_NFesSYpyVNQ,"Really enjoyed this NOLA classic counter breakfast lunch. They manage their line well, staff move the customers through efficiently but without rushing.. food was excellent as hoped. I enjoyed the Ruben, my wife loved the gumbo.. our son and daughter thought the burgers were excellent. We also shared a yummy, crispy waffle.. we will be back next trip!"
644,5xp9d_E5AOr9Si2510JzyA,"This place is ridiculously good. The chef's special omelette is delicious, and way more food than i actually needed. Our server, Leon, was great: we were a party of 7 and he handled all our orders super quickly!"
645,J14gimut69Jky4N_7XTImA,"Definitely a must try! The food was delicious! With the exception of the grumpy and unwelcoming cashier, the staff behind the counter is phenomenal, especially our waiter Vernell! He was so pleasant and personable. I would recommend The Camellia Grill to anybody."
646,vjX1s4apLU_z6vj6H_rBFQ,"An old friend of mine took my college buddies and I to this place during Mardi Gras in the mid-90's.  It was so incredible, I begged everyone to go back to the place at least once more during the 4-day trip (which is nuts, because why wouldn't you want to eat in as many different places as possible while in New Orleans???). It was just THAT good, and the people were awesome. I hope all is back up and running after Katrina, etc. I always look back fondly on the Camellia Grill."
647,3nv3GLVtuCcWLbcmd6nS3w,"One of the main reasons I'm going back to New Orleans in October.  (the first being to remove a curse placed on me by a voodoo practicing street person whose parrot I inadvertently sang the wrong song to). 

Long story.

Our waiter looked just like, and was every bit as cool as, Elvis Costello.  The Pecan Pie was so incredible I began to ask strangers if they were sure they were going to finish theirs.  All of their food is hardy and just makes you feel good.  The chili omelette - the thick, meaty burgers.  ""Warms the heart"" kinda food.  

We took a streetcar (named Desire?) from the far side of the French Quarter which allowed us to experience the beautiful Garden District in which the grill resides.  Definitely away from Bourbon Street tomfoolery, but well worth the sojourn."
648,WA-LC7Vb-w8conhbsKQNyQ,"I've only been here once, and the piece of coconut custard pie I had was delicious.  The servers were friendly and courteous.  So, why the 3 stars??? 

Ok, I hate writing a bad review (I really do), but the cleanliness of this restaurant really left something to be desired.  If you have OCD or any kind of fear of germs, I suggest you do not go inside!  First, there were flies on the food.  Understandable- this happens.  What can you do?  Second, you get to watch them prepare the food.  This could actually be pretty cool, but it wasn't.  I did not see anyone wear gloves, or wash their hands after touching raw eggs/meat, etc. They then touch plates, utensils, put their hands all over bread for sandwiches, uncooked veggies for the sandwiches, etc.  Honestly, it was a little too much for me to handle.  I don't know how this place passes a health department inspection.  

However, from what I hear the food is good (and my pie was yummy), so if you don't care about all that, go ahead and check it out!  A lot of people love it.  Personally, I will never go back."
649,8HLxagSJSGcXQtmbE-gifw,people always talk about how chic fil a's service is unmatchable. oh honey. the waiters here are angels sent from HEAVEN. i feel like i am in a story book every time i am here. food is great and there are a ton of options. bonus points for being open late. i always leave camellia with a smile on my face!
650,zsiH3lPTm1FuYv_iyNi2dQ,"My favorite diner. Fantastic omelettes and the best hashbrowns in the city. I particularly recommend the Mexican omelette and the chili cheese omelette. The hamburgers are also very good. The chocolate freeze with ice cream has to be my favorite frozen concoction in the city. I have been eating here for at least 50 years, and I am never disappointed. It's the perfect cap to a good evening. My favorite waiter is Dennis, with whom I sit when I come in between Thursday and Sunday nights."
651,bIAdyqeWspAestHsm7Q5ug,"We hit the one in the Quarter. Wow, the staff was super cool, we had Jack as our waiter. We asked him what to get and he suggested the Harry's Yankee. Of course, with a side of onion rings. WOW. It was great, and the sauce that came with it...I could have done shots of it! We had a large party and everyone was happy with their food. Check this joint out if stumbling around the Quarter. We tried to suggest it to some random old people that were walking by as we were coming out, but our Urban Style must have scared em off...they pretty much ran away. Maybe they snuck back to try it. Maybe they are STILL running. Nah...old people can't run that well."
652,4jAk2FbJmixAVftGSCG0BQ,"This is one of the more fun breakfast experiences I've ever had. My BFF had been talking up the Camellia Grill for months and months, so it was on top of my list when I came back. 

We went here for breakfast. First thing to know is that you should expect to wait when you go. It's a small 50's-reminiscent place that mostly seats their patrons at the counter.  But I guarantee that it is worth the wait. It is a diner that serves greasy food, surely there are plenty of those elsewhere, you say? Wrong! The servers are what separates this place from other greasy spoons. They are HILARIOUS. Let me repeat that: H-I-L-A-R-I-O-U-S! And they were never mean-spirited about it. They're just real characters who elevate your diner experience to a different level.

I had the omelette and my cousin had a burger. While good, I think they were just a smidgen better than standard diner fare. But the milkshake... LOVE! Couple that chocolate cherry milk shake with an avalanche of compliments from the staff? I was in love! (Hey, I am only human! Good breakfast served with a hefty side of compliments is ALWAYS appreciated!)

I plan to go back here next time I am in town. For greasy food, hilarious people, and (hopefully) more awesome compliments!"
653,zt9LoxEqJMTij-AJIuXlsg,"A trip to NOLA just isn't complete unless you go to the Grill for breakfast - just take the trolley to the end of the line, walk into the Grill (after waiting in line for 20 mins or so!) and you feel like you've stepped back in time.  Great vintage diner with outstanding, friendly service where the cooks have never met a stranger and chat with you as if they've known you since childhood.  A college buddy introduced me to Camellia Grill in the mid 80's and it hasn't changed a bit.  Just wish I'd known about it sooner!"
654,nFOZhoJzodIK5E6Gpi0APQ,Breakfast done right in the garden district.  Great little diner with only counters.  Reminds me of Apple Pan with that down home friendliness.  Eggs were perfectly cooked with good portions.  Friendly service.  This is traditional breakfast so don't expect any fancy stuff..just eggs and stuff along with some darn good grits.
655,Jf93uubfX2vT2Fwe-d4LOg,"Someone reviewed this place and called it ""a place for tourists"", and while this is true, locals shouldn't be afraid to check this place out.

First of all, if you go for breakfast, be prepared to wait in a line.  This is an extremely popular breakfast place.  Whenever I go, it's usually for a late (after 9) dinner.  I like the hamburgers.  They are prepared on the griddle, right in front of you and they actually toast the hamburger buns in the burger grease.  Yeah, it's not the healthiest, but, wow, is it good!

This is also the only place that I will actually consume a milkshake.  I am sure they are probably 1,000 cals a serving, but it's nice to treat yourself every once in a while."
656,3syjdH1GKllQM2Okj5KreA,"The pancakes are so buttery, absolutely delicious. Worth the wait! We had a group of 6 people so it was difficult to sit us all together but the host was super nice. Eventually he was able to sit us in 2 separate sections."
657,YzLdMYNUIr5k3Rx6gGMhvA,"feels like youre stepping back in time at this place, a real old school diner. the layout is fun and the guys who work there are making jokes and making sure everyone is having a good time while they cook. we loved coming here on our last day, great greasy homemade diner food. the club sandwich was perfect, super cheap meal, definitely recommend."
658,l34ws66ZYMu9_XfI6tnIhA,Well I was told to come here 35 plus years ago by my aunt and I just now made it. I've been coming to New Orleans since I was 13 and I'm 50. Well this is a old fashioned dining experience that you don't find new anymore. I had the chef's special it was a omelet with bacon and cheese covered in chili. My wife had a waffle with bacon and it cost 21.00. Will come back next trip.
659,_tVyeMai227aDwOe_klINg,"A family member from Memphis, TN recommended this place. Wow! what a great place to eat. we had breakfast , I ordered an omelet with corn beef hash it was just  like my moms. we had great service and a very polite server.
The waffles are great, and the coffee was delicious not to strong and not weak.

I will highly recommend this grill, not expensive."
660,VaBxELBXZDcQ7qgihGdw6A,"A New Orleans institution. So glad they came back after the hurricane! It's far better than your average greasy spoon. The U-shaped counters and the loud, funny waiters also make for a cool experience.

I used to always get a chili cheese omelet (oh.my.god.), but since going semi-veg I've had the pecan waffle instead, which is still to die for. We also tried the chocolate pecan pie this time, which was insanely decadent. Pecan pie is bad enough for you already, but then they bake in some chocolate, throw it on the grill before serving, and squirt on a little liquid butter just for good measure."
661,v5N0sGB4sVaiiua1KDW8uw,"Nothing exotic just simple burgers, sandwich etc.  Fun atmosphere and ""interesting"" people coming and going."
662,unnn8Ob55M1aENbAQhZ_XQ,"I have eaten here before and the food is great. I came back to town today and wanted to come back. The greeter at the door was very rude. We decided to get a freeze to go and stood under the ""Stand here for To Go Orders"" for over 5 minutes and no one acknowledged my existence. It was VERY disappointing. I have given so many recommendations for this place in the past. Oh well, The Trolly Car Cafe has now taken its place. It's all about service in the food industry."
663,nNyGNMf2f9nsLOY34nICXA,"This was the final stop to our eat-a-thon of New Orleans.  Located uptown, it is located right off the near end-of-line for the St. Charles streetcar and it literally drops you off right in front of the Camellia Grill. 

We arrived on a Monday morning and lucky for us, we were seated quickly at two seats.  There are no booths in this place--it's all counter which is nice and unique.  It definitely beckons to older, simpler times. 

I ordered a mushroom omelet, and dear Lord, I honestly have to say it was the most buttery, fluffy one that I have ever had before.  It was HUGE, too.  I know I should have been watching what I ate considering the previous days of eatin', but I couldn't resist.  They also don't give you the ""home fries"" that you might normally see at breakfast places--they just give you a pile of french fries.  The other half had a pecan waffle that was pretty damn good, too, and filled with, well, pecans. 

Service was fantastic, and our server was attentive and made small talk with us as we were looking over the menu.   We were seated next to two other folks that were in town from Boston and we both spoke of our culinary feats/experiences since we arrived in town. 

If you're uptown and need some good breakfast, good company, and good service Camellia Grill definitely should be the place you check.  Check your pretenses at the door, though, cause in a place like this, there's not much room for it."
664,Id-7zpKIKwMPpPHuhIUITw,"I came here on the advice of my cab driver while on vacation.  I don't know how it didn't stand out during my search on yelp; I was so glad I followed his advice.  The place is adorable and retro.  Nothing but counter seating. The waiters are what make this place special.  They are friendly and fun and it's refreshing to see them joke around with each other.  The most amusing thing was watching Penut (our waiter) cook our omelettes and then come back and tell a story about the Manning brothers eating there.  

I got the healthiest omelette on the menu which was great.  My friend got one with chili on it. I tried it and it was surprisingly wonderful.  Also, the fried mac and cheese was divine.  The orange freeze was so refreshing and lighter than a milk shake."
665,u9Q4ahku2fA11WZI6v1pfw,"Let's be serious . . .you really are not coming here for great food.  No.  What you are coming here is for the show, for the serving of food in this counter only diner is what is worth the trip out to check it out.

We went on a Saturday morning and of course, the place was packed.  We stood in line for 45 minutes only to be let into the air conditioned space to continue waiting on the banquettes for another 20.  Finally, we got a seat at the counter.  Know that there are ONLY seats at the counter.  

Each section is attended to by jovial server who will take your order, read it off to the cook and then serve it to you.  The food was basic at best, I had a turkey club, my friends had a burger and we all split some ""cheese fries"" (forget about ordering those- they are basically fries with slices of american cheese on top using the heat of the fries to melt it.  Not so good)  The best things were the onion rings and the club sandwich.

What I did like was the automation.  You could see how they had stocked the freezers, measuring out just the perfect portion of food.  The meat patties were separated by waxed paper, the deli meats proportioned out,the pie cut perfectly.  

And because you are practically sitting on top of the person next to you, you learn that the place is chock full of tourists whose cities are shouted out occasionally by the servers to create a little competition between patrons.

And if you need the restroom, know that you must go up through the back kitchen where they must prep for the front of the house.

I wanted to love it like so many of these other Yelp reviews.  But in my book?  There are far better places to grab breakfast or lunch in NOLA.  It wasn't bad . . . it just wasn't anything special."
666,Pbb8H2v8vU5SO--rbmEwUg,No matter where my family goes for burgers my parents always compare it to Camellia's burgers. They last had their burgers here over 20 years ago and til this day they stick to Camellia's burgers as the best burgers they have ever had (They have pretty much had burgers from all over the world). Open one up in Southern California please! Share the burger awesomeness with the west coast Camellia's!
667,gG9dVIRBgkbBXEBcEbq4Rw,"This was the last stop on our New Orleans food tour.  We heard this place got pretty packed for breakfast, so decided to go a little after lunch. No line, but still packed. The burger and onion rings were great! But the best was the Pecan Pie for dessert. They actually heat it up on the grill. It melts in your mouth."
668,VRj1ADTwjEhi7TJvOt9d-A,"A New Orleans Uptown Tradition for drunk Tulane and Loyola students, tourists and Sunday Morning brunchers but the thing that keeps them coming in is the service. The crew that works here will keeps you entertained from the wait till the check with all the fun and flare that has made this place famous. The food is non-descript diner food but its still an experience you must try atleast once."
669,rRWQ6C_8kLTwJCGO-13ozw,"UPDATE: Not as slow the last few times and they accept cards now 

ALWAYS SO SLOW when we go in for to go milkshakes and are obviously just standing there waiting to get our milkshake and go. Something that should take 3-5 min turns into 15-20mjBut they're burgers are pretty good and obviously their chocolate & cherry milkshake is my favorite."
670,iQPlPY0id50_Yd07D3tmSQ,"Saw this place on an episode of Somebody feed Phil. Said the next time in in town I'm definitely paying them a visit. 
This place has a old school diner feel, the waiters wear white shirts with black bow ties. The serve breakfast and lunch but I highly suggest getting the breakfast. The food came out very fast. I got the pancakes, two eggs, hash browns and bacon. The hash Browns were crispy and you can even get served with cheese. 
The pancakes we so light and fluffy and were really delicious. I hate going to restaurants and they give you cold butter. This place has gotten it right. They serve melted butter alongside your maple syrup which complimented the pancakes perfectly.. 
if you go in the weekend be prepared for a long wait."
671,5bHoJlo_vyq0u0PNgz6Z-g,"Great atmosphere, extremely greasy omelet and potatoes. All gumbos are not created equal."
672,JXwlxcp851PdTHb470UQdQ,"A fun place! It was recommended to us as a must stop during our vacation. We were told the shakes and omelettes were great. The omelettes and shakes were delicious but their other items such as their cheeseburgers, fries, and pancakes were also great. It was a fun joint from another time. The seating is at the counter, which forces you to make conversation with other people. We ate dinner here twice and during our first visit a very nice couple found out we were from out of town and gave us some history on the restaurant  and their staff.  They also shared that after Katrina the restaurant had been closed for long period of time. They also gave us suggestions on other restaurants and things to do. The servers were all having fun and very attentive. The only negative thing about this diner would be the cashiers. We were there on two different nights and there was was a different cashier on each night. They were not friendly nor welcoming. No smile, no greeting, no thank you. We said hello and on the first night I asked them if we could just sit down or if they would call us. I could barely make out a response. On the second night the cashier was eating right there in the open, which I don't think should happen while you are working. Anyway, the meal was great. The servers and other customers made this place a must go to!"
673,32x9OjDHx-Seu_l_ew9zDw,"Fresh off my flight in a new place and guess what? I'm starving. 

There wasn't anything open near my hotel and by the time, I got off my flight, checked in, settled etc. it was getting really really late and choices were slim. Luckily, we found this late night diner and I got my first taste of southern hospitality. 

Since I skipped breakfast due to the last minute rush, etc., I was craving it and since it's a late night diner, they had plenty of breakfast options and I got a nice helping of pancakes, eggs, and bacon.

This is a small diner. You're seated at a bar facing the kitchen - literally. You order and they cook it up right in front of you. The bride ordered the chocolate freeze and when I told the guy I wanted to try some - he whipped me up one on the house just for being new to NOLA - see what I mean by southern hospitality??

Food was made to order, fresh, hot off the grill and just oh so wonderful and such a wonderful treat for my first day in NOLA. Also, it was super cheap."
674,v1bAwRyKZPPl8qFsEsAbtw,"All style, little substance.

We love the service, the architecture, the retro counters, menus and malt glasses - everything but the food. 

In the best eating town in America, you'd think diner food would be elevated. But, you'd be wrong. This is really just a Bob's Big Boy with much better trimming."
675,1ga8l_e7ygvGQy_h4xPkRQ,"Good food fast. The service is very friendly. Prices are great too. The whole place is one long counter where everyone sits, so you're always rubbing elbows with other diners, it's not a problem, but you have to be comfortable with it."
676,Dt8XFSlvUv86m2tRlw6kmA,"Camellia Grill is the definition of a cute little diner with to-die-for food. You might be thrown off when you walk in, as it is a small space and viewing kitchen. But that opinion will go in their garbage when you sink into a pecan waffle, or slurp a chocolate freeze. And, if that wasn't enough, the customer service is BEYOND amazing."
677,qWzJ2CYNZ2buL3IToCa6KQ,Food- you get what u see so 3/5. Service from our friendly server -4/5 . Lovely old-timey diner ! A bit squashy because of limited seating and there's probably a line you hv to wait in . I tot prices were reasonable and our server was smiley ( thereate so many grumpy ones elsewhere ) those the one who seats you can be a little draconian . You will see what I mean ...We ordered the burger and fries and a freeze/milkshake. Lovely ! I would recommend coming to this place for a meal after a ride on the Streetcar and a visit to the Lafayette cemetery .
678,VuN16mWOXaE5VophmJ7Seg,"What a cool place! Unique New Orleans feel at this no frills 24 hour diner. I went while staying with a friend at Tulane, which is just up St. Charles. Service was great and they are fun to watch an interact behind the counter. Since there is only counter seating this is easy to do! I got the Chili Omelet that was DELICIOUS. I can sorta compare this place to Waffle House or Pit Grill, only 1,000X better and more authentic. Heavy food though."
679,Rg8rVtXYVZAfqwoHCaotug,"Oh how unremarkable Camellia Grill is. Whenever I need a good laugh I like to drive past all the sheep waiting in line for mediocre diner food. How this place ever became a New Orleans institution is beyond me. The burgers are tasteless, the fries are frozen and again tasteless. Their shakes are ok, I guess. But here's what really gets my goat. Don't you DARE put cheese fries on a menu if all you are going to do is slap a cold piece of American ""cheese product"" on warm french fries. It's an insult and I won't have any of it. 

The experience is the only positive part. They have friendly waiters that give you daps and make you feel as if you are a part of something. Overall, there are far better places in this city for cheap diner food. My guess is that 30 years ago this place was the bomb and people can't let it go that its not good anymore; or how the newer and younger competitors are doing it better."
680,2KGygt5T9clAIYv4MpgDmw,"Camellia Grill was my last taste of Nola before I had to return to NJ.  After the mayhem that is the red dress run, I needed some quality food to bring me back to 100%.  Camellia Grill was the choice and I was not disappointed food wise.  The food is make quick, fresh, and served by one of the most entertaining staff I have ever seen.  Anything with chili on top is great and the waffles are just divine.  The one gripe I had was the wait to get a table.  Because Camellia Grill is so popular, expect a 45 min to 1 hr wait.
Grade: B-"
681,mlD2eE2pfXkh3n1mapArJg,Horrible. Has really gone downhill in the past few years. Extra filthy. Cold food. All personable servers gone. Very meh experience. Notice the many of the 1 star filthy experiences within the month.
682,aR1hV-OeBrdEmBV1Ug0Keg,"The absolute BEST omelette I've ever had in my life. It  was just a plain sausage and cheese omelette but it was so airy and fluffy and rich that no omelette I've had since can live up to it (I ate here a couple of years ago.)

Totally worth the lines!"
683,AVr95L2al6JX8xFSJc_8qw,"I think they serve nectar soda here. Nectar is a mix of almond and vanilla flavors and it's red. You might want to give it a try. 

I ordered the patty melt (the ""Doc Brinker's special""). It comes with small sides of chili and cole slaw. I like my chili sweet so I added some sugar to it. The cole slaw was very good. They add some small pieces of carrot to it. Nice touch. 

I guess the omelets here are legendary. Some people even eat them for dinner.They serve breakfast all day. The pecan waffles are also very good."
684,HJdI5Fo-m39Phyhoc1LMJg,Awesome service and even better food! I got the pecan waffle with bacon on top and it was AMAZING! My friend got the breakfast poboy and she was just as happy. I highly recommend this spot for breakfast/brunch!
685,M7XZg54VcTdvqz1f2RlLNw,"This is my go to place for late night eats. This place does get busy, but they do have off hours (you will know when that is by driving by). so i usually go at the off hours. I love that they cook the food in front of you. Their burgers always hits the spot. yummy!"
686,FyRiHntFdJyB4baaydCh9A,This place has a lot of character and the guys all have unique personalities. Each person prepares their portion of your meal with a practiced flair and it is always good.
687,nf9HnRiMZsBw3gOxuArBwg,"Standard American diner, with friendly staff. Ordered 2 Eggs and the Chicken Judges hot sandwhich. Eggs were fine and came with a side of toast but the Chicken judges sandwhich was a total disappointment. I would have been better off getting a footlong oven roasted chicken sub from Subway. It would have more trimmings and would have been much more filling than this sandwhich."
688,tJaUk2aH09EN9bM89MvbdQ,"Terrible. Have fun with your food born illness. Cooks don't wash hands, wipe utensils on neighboring surfaces and really look to make you sick. 

I know it's on the streetcar and used to be a ""legend"", but save your hard earned money for anywhere else. 

Seriously, ANYWHERE ELSE."
689,hpIU9fOE8zBqJq2Ia1XV_w,"I've been coming here for years (although it may be years between visits now bc Im forced to live six hours away now ) and it is always so good I can't handle it. I've never had their pecan pie until this week (twice this week). You haven't lived until you've had their pecan pie. Not lying. My kid won first place at a county fair in tx for her pecan pie and the pie at camellia grill makes hers taste like trash. 
Great burgers. Great omelets. Best hamburger steak ever. The pancakes will make you punch the person next to you. 
I can't tell you enough how much I love this place."
690,OVbJmxbNpboJSe9exV5_AA,"AMAZING! The food was so so good, and the staff was very friendly. I will say, prepare yourself for a wait. The restaurant is all counter-top and first come first served. But, once you get that coveted seat, prepare your taste buds for a delightful adventure."
691,kTw8P4YDSgefpSYnXB_7_w,"The ""Grill,"" as it is more commonly referred to by locals, is a welcomed sight (and taste) back from Hurricane Katrina. It suffered damage like many other New Orleans eateries, some which never returned. It took awhile longer for the Grill's resurrection, bit it was worth the wait. 
As many things in this city, tradition reigns true here - from the white cloth napkins, the marble countertop, the late-night hours, and the Mickey Mouse clock on the wall - aged with the passage of time and stained by the hazard of hanging above the gigantic griddle and fryers.  But the charm of this place comes from the wait staff, dressed in white cotton tops and black bow ties.  Some of these guys have worked here their entire lives. The Grill is like going home and having your dad serve as a short-order cook. 

Omelets, made from eggs whipped in a shake blender, are served with french fries that are just as good as the omelet itself.  Specialties of the house include the Western Omelet, and Potato & Onion (try it, trust me), and the ultimate: Chili Cheese Omelet, not for the weak of heart (or stomach).  Pecan waffles are also popular, but their Pecan Pie is better.  Ask to have it heated on the grill.  There's nothing like it in the world.

Hamburgers are the underrated delicacy here.  Perhaps that's why they are highlighted in the menu - but there are so many other good choices that hamburgers are usually 4th or 5th on the wish list.  Still, they may not be much to look that, but the magic lies within that grill.  They taste superb!

The Camellia Club is a monster of a club sandwich, complete with FRESH turkey breast meat.  That's why probably makes it so good.  While there, you'll see freshly-cooked bacon, stacked high on a plate near the griddle, as BLT's and other sandwiches, burgers, and even omelets are often complemented with a slice.

And finally, save room for a Freeze - a frozen concoction blended with fresh vanilla ice cream.  The mocha is my personal favorite!

A must-see for every tourist and a must-dine-often for every local!"
692,skz6-5BYc6EHLl67eDxhDw,"Camellia Grill is a New Orleans institution. You feel like you stepped back in time when you walk into the beautiful old building and are served at a counter by men in bow-ties. Despite the bow-ties, it is very casual and family friendly. You can choose from typical diner food or New Orleans staples, and it's all good. If you're visiting, take a leisurely St. Charles street car ride and enjoy the views of mansions and Audubon Park on the way. You get to sit next to locals as well as tourists and have nice conversations."
693,_HbB0QT-WnaGH4DgpouK2w,"Old timely diner... mostly counter space. True diner menu, breakfast anytime, burgers, fried stuff... not real expensive. 
I've seen people waiting outside to get in (It's not real big). 
Anyway, passable food.
THE FOOD:
I had a bacon burger, onion rings, and chili. 
Babycakes had a Reuben sandwich.
The bacon burger was good, decent size, tasty...  
The onion rings were pretty good. Just frozen rings fried.. kind of like bar food onion rings.
The chili had beans, kinda thick, not great... not sure if it's canned, it might be. 
The Reuben sandwich was also not great, the corned beef is grilled to death on a flat top, fatty...but not tasty fatty. Sauerkraut was also not great. 
The best thing to say is that it wasn't too expensive.
Nice to experience an iconic New Orleans diner, though."
694,qc9d_oHM7a32qY2i5ne5XA,"Anew Orleans institution, The Camilla Grill is an old school restaurant with a serpentine counter.

Today, I came here for breakfast.  It was delicious and prepared perfectly.

In the past, I have eaten many things on the menu.  They, in my opinion, make the best hamburger.  If you want agrease-driping, heart stopping traditional hamburger,this is your place."
695,B2s1jUJg_1EEGrl_il7_yg,"The service is quick and efficient and the menu is straight forward. You enter and are seated immediately if seats are available. It's a fast pace diner. Only counter seats. You order, food is fresh and you can watch as they cook it, after eating you can pay the person at the door and you hand the tip to the server.

My fiancé and I went there for breakfast.

I ordered the muffuletta - first time having it and it's quite an entree. I would say it's a bit heavy for breakfast. Their menu has a breakfast section and then the rest is more for lunch or dinner, but I guess it really depends on the person. I usually don't eat breakfast, or eat something very small for breakfast; the size of the muffuletta was 10 inches long, roughly. I only finished half of it.

My fiancé had a breakfast entree with eggs, sausage hash brown, and toast. 

I would say the food gets four stars; standard food you could find anywhere else but the atmosphere and experience is what we came for. They're a a variety of people - tourist and locals."
696,q3tpmFGyRHTDp5IsiQx8hA,"First time back since Marvin ""Word"" passed. I've come here dozens of times over past 30 years. A real disappointment. Burger and O rings I ordered were ok but my wife's order was really messed up and It was not super busy. She had to ask Michael, can you please check on my order, this was about after 5 min after I got my burger. Her omelette came same time as a couple seated long after us got their order. She then asked for wheat toast that never came. We paid and left and passed Micheal on a smoke break .  Sorry to report The soul has left Camellia.  What used to be a fun, entertaining and lively experience with good food is no more."
697,B7R6m5R_GZNSvuMYL2vAhg,"As a Nola Native Camellia Grill never gets old. As always the service was great. I was surprised to see the chefs weren't singing like I remember as a child. The atmosphere is always relaxing. 
Food: Chef Special Omelette- Filling, delicious."
698,OsP-OGyPH1saTvbY5Az7sA,"This place is the bomb! It's all about the atmosphere. The guys behind the counter put on a show you won't see at any other diner. That alone is worth the price of your meal. My omelette (I believe it was the house special with ham, tomatoes, cheese, and chili) was huge and delicious. But.....the pecan pie I had was totally awesome. I'm NOT a dessert guy but it had to be the best I've ever had. Don't miss this place if you're in Nawlins."
699,ffA6pApfMv6_AkwKDOHNgQ,"Made a visit the other day for the first time in a long time. Wanted to see what was similar and what was different from the old days. Not just before the failure of the federal levee system in 2005 but from way back.

A great deal is the same and that is good as far as the food, service and ambiance of this New Orleans institution. 

My test on this visit was the Pecan Waffle. That is a choice that many places just tend to mess up in the worst way. And if you want to really get on my bad side serve me a waffle with pecans thrown on top of the cooked waffle.

But Camellia Grill has always and still does it right. A rich batter on the hot waffle iron with the pecan thrown into the batter as the top is placed down for the cooking. A side order of bacon makes this a must try dish no matter the time of day. 

A little disappointment with the change over from the melted butter from the past in the little green holders to whatever they use today that passes for butter. 

The Mocha Freeze was heavenly. Joe who was the waiter on Station One was good. Miss the picture of the other Harry from the old days that was on the wall near his station."
700,lsydXi-264rIrfUb8oyY-w,Best omelette ever. Worth the trolley ride which is fun anyway. Add jalapeños to the veggie omelette:)
701,TcolBE3pQIDg9DHp_9FzSw,Love this place. Always a go to when we are in the the Garden District. Good honest food fast and at a great price. The vibe is pure New Orleans
702,9Grz-79nYLpP0Xp2062pYQ,"A local friend told us about this place and it definitely should not be missed.  Fresh and delicious local fare, casual atmosphere and friendly hospitality.  We loved the red beans and rice, shrimp poboy, slaw and especially the coconut pie... the absolute best I've ever tasted. Thanks Michael, our server and Joe on the grill!!"
703,vl8MUsLP_ibAGGDDb77-Gg,"Food was great here. Per Yelp, I got the Juju Julu omelet with the grits. The grit, I swear, was on point. So was the one pancake that I ordered on the side. I don't know if I was just hungry or if the food is just awesome. 

I'm not a big grits person but they were definitely just like my grandma used to make them for me every once in a while. And a pancake was made with 100% buttermilk which just so different than what I've been used to in the north. 

Definitely, somewhere to try for breakfast. Do know they stop saying grits after 11 am."
704,OURFmjIe_10B-oQ556_6xQ,Never had a bad meal.  I used to go here with my folks after a full night of drinking with them for some special occasion.  Haha great place.
705,OhGKPIKraQExDEjF-Pdl2A,"If you haven't had camellia grill, it is a must try. It's also I nice experience as well. You get to sit at the bar and watch the chefs cook your food. All the food is delicious. What I say this place is known for is their BANANA CREME PIE! Mouth watering pie ! It's the best ever and definitely a must try. If you do not like to go to the city, the company has opened another location on veterans memorial Blvd called ""The Grille"" right next to Trader Joe's. They have everything plus more & more family seating. Inside and outside tables."
706,6efpenz_E2D20jJoRQeXOA,"Hmmm... I have no review for Camellia Grill? OK, I must alleviate that post haste! I have loved Camellia Grill since I first stepped in for breakfast oh so many moons ago. I realize that many people complain about the wait; some say it's worth it, while others say no. There is a limit to the amount of time that I will wait for Camellia. Am I going to stand in some long line that stretches to that weird new frozen yogurt place? No. Luckily, I've never been in this position. If you would like to enjoy your breakfast at Camellia, get there early. College kids are the ones filling up the spaces at the counter and they won't get up until 9:30 at the earliest. Beat them to the punch. Carpe Freezum. (Seize the Freeze) 
Once you get a space at the counter (hopefully you're on Marvin's side), enjoy an oversized omelet gushing forth with cheese. If you have no plans for later in the day except chugging back some Pepto or you're lucky enough to be born with an iron-clad stomach, get both your omelet and fries covered in that delicious glowing chili. The pecan waffle, although slightly Eggo-like to me, is very yummy as well. Also get one of those wonderful freezes - Carpe Freezum. Camellia will be busy from about 10am until 3pm on the weekends. It's just gonna be that way folks, sorry. If, however, you crave one of those little slices of heaven that comes with a bacon cheeseburger during this time period, call them up and place a to-go order. Watch as all those people standing in line drool over the glorious smell of grease that leaves with you. Grin as you take a long draw on your cherry chocolate freeze. Wave to the people. Blow them kisses. (OK, doing those last two things probably would classify you as an ass.) But know that all this can be yours, if the time is right. Of course there is always the late night Camellia run; be a little tipsy, bring some good company, and crave greasy food. Enjoy."
707,dvMWVZ2sQIqeMptYuRr_uw,"Great Atmosphere....Super Busy but its a cute diner.... The wait was about 30-45 mins, however once you got seated they served you ASAP or waiter was Will... he gave us such great service!!"
708,051Qn12m-XQvCm4iTk1wCA,"There are two locations for the Camellia Grill, but I have never been to the location in the French Quarter.  The location on Carrollton is my go to spot for late night eats and, since I don't really go out that much anymore, for those occasions when I need a classic burger.  The burgers are simple and direct, you basic diner burger, but they have a few unusual types of burgers like the Doc Brinker Special, which is a double burger in rye.  Its excellent.  

They also specialize is ""Freezes"" which are essentially milkshakes that have alittle more ice in them, and omelets, which are huge.  The menu is rounded with both hot and cold sandwiches and usually breakfast fare.  

The staff is really what makes this place shine however.  They are friendly, loud, and quick to joke.  There are no tables so everyone gets to sit at the counter.  This can also mean long lines however, which pretty much last throughout the weekend during dining times.  

Visitors and locals alike should take the streetcar from Canal to Carollton and get breakfast / lunch and/or dinner at Camellia.  Walk around the river bend, get a daq at Originals or beer at Cooter Browns, and take the streetcar back (after finishing that daq and/or beer since they typically don't allow drinks on the streetcars).  You will be glad you did!"
709,DHfWL5UPiE7OTLipMUEYkA,"Family and I were touring Audubon Park. We ran into a local who recommended this place. We are so glad we stopped in, the food and service was amazing!!"
710,ZNT79T37-6Td9qTu7dFK1g,"Good diner chow at a New Orleans institution. I'd suggest you try somewhere else for peak breakfast hours (the lines are just plain stupid), but for a late-night grease it can't be beat, at least not in Carrollton."
711,PcC-jIoZBwIrvMLFGkTKNg,99% of the staff seemed lovely and friendly and kind but the asshole at the door and his treatment of myself and my party precluded me from trying what looked like a very crowded glorified Waffle House.
712,uBeK8l1Qf6fOaSdLhp5Zrg,"Stopped here for lunch, my co-worker suggested the cheese fries with roast beef gravy. I can confirm, they are delicious. The cheese is nice and melty american cheese with the perfect consistency of brown gravy with tender roast beef pieces.

The restaurant itself has a cool set up. I like that you can sit and watch them prepare your food from the counter. The chairs all surround the grill area, very diner style.

Friendly workers, it feels like a real homey place to dine!
Ill be back for sure."
713,Et3mKe5DsRwXInMd8qBolQ,This was not the place I remembered and loved. My husband and I were visiting from out of town and decided to stop at the legendary Camellia grill. The service was fine but the food was awful. My hashbrowns were overcooked and greasy while the turkey omelet was ok. Just nothing special. My husband preceded to go use the restroom and saw things in the kitchen that were not up to code and it was filthy. I got so disgusted I didn't finish my food.
714,Up43f8JRKFGXNHtgeSpLWQ,I absolutely LOVE the muffuletta and service. They are extremely nice and always close by if needed. You can watch them fix your food and talk to the cooks as you watch. The food is fresh and seasoned just right. I highly recommend The Camellia Grill.
715,KArpB0KFESIcPmVioMOosA,"This place came highly recommended and it didn't disappoint. From the moment we sat down we all nodded our heads in agreement that the service (Will) and the food were on point. We will definitely add this to the ""must do"" when we visit again."

I ordered two eggs over medium, wheat toast and pecan pancakes.  Yup, I was hungry and ate it all.  Everything was incredible.  The staff is so friendly.  The building is unique and full of character.  I enjoyed the open kitchen.  When you walk back to the bathroom, you walk through the entire place.  No secrets here!  Best breakfast in NOLA and when its not Mardi Gras, a quick trolley ride from the french quarter."
718,7V399bWZws4HQN_KIq95dg,"Best burgers, old time diner with such great  ambiance, hope it's around forever, depending on day long line outside to get in but so worth it"
719,iC-z--PjLFxXprYGKAREDQ,"File under institutions.  Also file under better experienced when there is no line as waiting for what amounts to mid 20th century American diner food may seem just a little silly.  Then again it may not.  That said, you can call it in for pick up but half of eating at Camellia is the parlance, the texture, and the je ne sais quoi.

My most recent visit took place after an evening of Tipitina's and Fess Fest, and the best way to finish one's nocturnal excursions is to top it off with 2 cheeseburgers dressed.  ""Dressed"" for the uninitiated equates to ""with everything.""  It is how you order po-boys or as indicated other sandwiches like hamburgers.  The locals can spot you a mile away if you order it otherwise; conversely I've found myself saying ""dressed"" in other cities and am instantly outed.  C'est la vie, c'est le menu.

There's nothing especially healthy about eating here other than it pleases your brain emotionally and your stomach physically but not so much your heart.  Also, the bathroom is tucked away way back through the labyrinth of back of house kitchen.  Among the wall graffiti and classic  tile you'll note the 16 or so foot ceilings.  And then one wonders ""If there's all this space seemingly unused back here, why so little seating up front?""  Chalk it up to one of the many things that make New Orleans New Orleans.

I hope I'm still eating here when I'm too old to drive, and I'm 36."
720,bd14Qo_l8VJh1-KfTmz7Fg,"Camellia Grill is the type of diners you see in the movies.  The atmosphere here is an overall good dining experience. I've been here twice, one for lunch and once for dinner. Countertop seating is where it's at here. There was no wait both times I've been there. Quick and attentive service has you in and out of there enjoying their delicious grill options and home-style cooking. Breakfast items are the classic American menu, with bacon, eggs, and more. The burgers were everything I would expect in a good burger. The patties had a nice taste and dressing options for the burger were plenty with fresh vegetables. The fries and onion rings were exceptional. This is a good place for chatting or even reading a book while eating, like I saw some people doing. The staff are familiar with the customers as well. Overall, Camelia's Grill delivers everything one would expect for a diner. This place is definitely a NOLA classic."
721,eZn0mMq33hYI4ymAjrjjjg,"I haven't been here post-Katrina, but this was my all-time FAVORITE place to go after a long night of bar hopping with my college friends.  The food is essentially a heart attack on a platter, but it is what it is - greasy hangover food.  You go for the ambience since it is a true New Orleans institution.  Your server will sing your order back to you and entertain.  Camellia Grill really is the best and I can't wait to go back since it sounds like it is reopen and ready for business!  The breakfast is good, the lunch is good, and so everyone will be happy!"
722,Wvkui6mOWd7B51s3ilUXFw,"Another amazing culinary experience in NOLA. This is the only place that has properly pulled off the old school diner. Other places do it wrong: they bullshit, they try applying modern touches to it, all they do is put up neon lights and the hood of a caddie in the corner, etcetc. But this place gets it right.  The whites everyone wears, the menu prices, the attitude of the employees, how the food is served, the clientele. It's not just suburban fucks, it's not just hipsters. I hope the hipsters don't ruin this place (like they ruin everything) when I come back. 

For what you pay, the food is amazing. You can't pay $4 for a waffle and expect all this urban yuppie ""organic"" bullshit. And that it is open until 0400 after a night of making an ass out of yourself in Marigny makes this place even better.

I need to move to this city."

By the time we got it, breakfast was no longer being served and there were only 3-5 lunch options, which was a little communist for my taste. The hamburger was good and cheap. Friends liked the fries and shakes."
726,WxEAVyfNeeVFdG6zo6P9UQ,"This place is oh so good. My best friend introduced me to this little spot back in 2011 on my first visit to NO. And we've gone back every time I've been in town. The staff is so friendly and fun! This place is tiny so there's usually a wait & it's bar style seating with everyone next to each other and a long countertop. 

The chocolate freeze is delicious & made with Blue Bell chocolate icecream! YUM! 
The fries, delsih and the burgerss.....oh em gee. Greasy goodness! Perfect hangover or cheat day food! 

I've only had their burgers, but Ive heard their breaskfast is amazing as well!"
727,5sag2m_43i_rb37i8k_Jcg,"Talk about a place that had its ups and downs, one of the great eating instutions in New Orleans, it was taken over by new management in 2004 and run into the ground, poor service, bad food, it actually made it onto my ""Famous but Overrated"" section. Katrina closed the place and it looked like the end. It reopened in 2007 under new management who vowed to reclaim its past glory and its on its way to doing just that. Marvin is back and the food and service staff is working hard to improve. I like breakfast there and in particular the pecan waffles, but its also well known for supper fluffy omelets and late night burgers. Not as cheap as you might think however."
728,iiJyP7YOyxRAeJiTIGCuZA,"First food stop taken in New Orleans. I ended up ordering:

1. Combination Baked Ham And Cheese Sandwich - double decked with lettuce, tomato & mayonnaise

This being my first time actually applying Southern Comfort food to my palate, I was a bit confused why where were pouring jars filled with yellow liquid. Turns out that the weather was so warm that it's not oil, but butter, just in case you need even more butter and grease to your Southern Food Experience!"
729,xepFHRi9SeIPgn2hrpz8kA,"Celebrated the start of my birthday celebration at one of my favorite places and as usual, they didn't let me down.  Great food, amazing service, and an eclectic vibe.  This place truly represents NOLA and it's culture.  Not a fancy spot for decor or ambiance but definitely a go to if you are here. 

It's a must on your list if you are here visiting."
730,ALegOUOazVB3GcOoXAvj7g,"This was our first dining experience as tourists in NOLA and we weren't disappointed!  

It was nice that we could come to this place without fighting the crowds in the french quarter.  We parked up the street in a lot meant for other businesses, but eh! It worked.

When we arrived at the Grill, the seating was filled but the wait was rather short and we were seated front and center.  I am curious as to why it takes two people to man the door for such a tiny place, however.  They seemed to mostly be standing there doing nothing.

We ordered some of your basics - burger, chicken sandwich, catfish, that sort of thing.  Everything came hot and tasty.  One of our sides was a bit 'short' (according to our server) so he had one of the cooks make up another huge basket of fries for us to cover it.  We took home a ton of fries!

It was a fun atmosphere to be at the counter and to watch the food being prepared.  The guys behind the counter were friendly as well.

The food was your typical diner type - a bit greasy but oh so tasty.  This set the stage nicely for our trip and was one of our favorite places looking back."
731,gdXLa51pnpLkkdzgzijjQg,"Was it worth the wait?  I'm not exactly sure.  Marvin, the waiter, is definitely a lot of fun but, honestly, he's not the best waiter.  It took forever for things to arrive and he had to be reminded about a couple of things.  The burger was really good and so was the chocolate pecan pie, however, the Coke was flat and that was disappointing (you need a nice cold Coke with your burger, right??).  If Marvin had asked once, ""How is everything?"" I would've told him and it might've been fixed.  But I had already asked once to get a new drink because I thought that he gave me Diet Coke the first time.

I have a feeling that I might've just had an awkward first experience.  It was fun and the food was really good.  Just not AMAZING."
732,_RzOp5zjLQb1vhomwi8QEQ,Amazing diner.  Felt like a local spot.  Service was aggressive but on top of it.  Amazing pecan pie a la mode.  I had the hot sausage sandwich which was really good.  We ate there twice on our trip and both times I got it.  The pancakes we great too.  I also had the gumbo and it was tasty as well.  Do you have to eat here?  Yes.
733,mZ50V_IvjgO1zK-2owQafQ,ALWAYS SO SLOW when we go in for to go milkshakes and are obviously just standing there waiting to get our milkshake and go. Something that should take 3-5 min turns into 15-20 min. But they're burgers are pretty good and obviously their chocolate & cherry milkshake is my favorite.
734,V-5YCZ2mzuaTDk1TXacF5Q,We had a great time at Camellia Grill!  The food was great! The people were wonderful!  We had great service! It was like stepping back in time!
735,hCin5sN5quPR16VLbPFOBg,"Late night food... This is my spot!

If I'm craving something to eat around 10 or 11 more than likely this is where I am going to head.

Imaging a Waffle House except NOT a Waffle House!  The waiters are as nice as can be, the place is clean, and the food is amazing for good ole diner food.

I get the same thing every time.  A bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich on wheat and a side of has brown.  You'll get more bacon than you've ever seen on a breakfast sandwich and the hash brown are nice and crispy.

They have both breakfast and dinner selections, but I always go with the breakfast."
736,dFcYB4w4ZpLou9-trYg3ow,Loved the Mexican omelette! Yum yum. The staff really make the experience worth it. Super friendly and very old school diner vibe (which is awesome).
737,zoBBynyCx0Eqyu_EcMepSg,"The Camellia Grill is a New Orleans institution. Most of my experiences, including my most recent, have been late night after going out on the town.

The servers are all characters who happily take your order and deliver greasy goodness to your seat at the bar. There are no real tables and you will have to wait, but its a must try.

One of the best things to do in this city is ride the Streetcar from downtown to Carollton, go to Camellia Grill and ride back. Try it some time. I guarantee an enjoyable experience."
738,ctYtr59egY9tHgxjAuJyQw,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? The place is an institution and I've been going there since I was literally weeks old. Same as it's been for ages, you cram up to the counter when I get my chance, have a phenomenal omelet or waffle, and remember the goods time I've had, whether after a parade or for breakfast with family when I was 3-4, or after a drunken night out in my 20's."
739,fLIWk2e-gZ16B-y0xQCEwA,"Finally made it to this landmark after all these years.

Perfect spot for a late night snack, it's busy in a friendly way, and they've got all the classics well done at a reasonable price.

Onion rings, gumbo, chocolate shake, cheeseburger - it was all good.

It's all counter seats so it helps if you enjoy making small talk with your neighbors."
740,deHclajo6o4gH6Do-OBIOg,"After a late night out in New Orleans, this is the place to get your greasy hangover cure! My partner and I made it in just before closing time. It's your typical greasy spoon. The place is small. There are bar stools around a counter with a nice view of the cooktops where the food is prepared. There are a few booths as well. The place was empty. We ordered the corned beef hash to go. The corned beef was flavorful as were the potatoes. There was a bonus pancake found underneath the hash that was pretty good too. This diner is a must visit whenever you're in the area!"
741,J-OR0XhnR8NZHJTIQcaNPw,Diner food and seating style throughout. Best pecan waffle I've had.  We also ordered the chili cheese omelette and they stuffed the cheese inside so that is was completely melted and gooey - YUM. I'm not a banana cream pie person but decided to try it and it was extremely creamy and smooth - MUST TRY.
742,-7o8j-XnQTLg76Dfxr1qqg,"I order take out, the lady on the phone was curt. I figured it was part of the diner charm and ignored it. 
When I arrived I stood under the sign that says stand here for take out orders. The toilet isn't too far away and boy it sure smelled standing there (red flag #1). 
The cashier said something to her friend who was seated close to her at other side of diner and then told me to come pay first(red flag #2).
I walked back to her and paid the bill. ($17 for a doc
Brinker sandwich and a freezie.)Then got $2 from my wallet and put it on the counter for the cook. Guess the cashier wanted the tip bc I could hear her say ""now why he tipping that man when I did all work collecting the man's order?!"" I turned around to make eye contact and smile politely but she looked towards her buddy at the counter and shook her head never making any eye contact with me (red flag #3). 
It took about 10 minutes to get my food and the place was depressingly empty. 
Got my food and it was the most burnt, dried out burger patties I've ever had.  Wrapped in greasy burned bread. 
In conclusion, this place fell off, skip and go to McDonald's for nicer service and better, way cheaper food. The place smells like a toilet too."
743,4jMGBb8gAGX2cFxHHJTmpQ,"Come here if you want to fill your stomach with soul food and leave wanting to take a nap with all the delicious food you just ingested.

Don't come here and expect the cleanest establishment.


MUST ORDER:

Pecan Pie, Chili, Pancakes, any po-boy, hasbrowns, omelettes.


You won't regret eating here, affordable and delicious, I don't think there's much more to want out of a Homey Diner."
744,pd0s2dMqgCWsk72jGHyBOg,"We started off on the right foot when our server Will made some recommendations and then gave us some samples. All of the food was amazing and I can't say enough about the service. Will seemed like he was genuinely interested in us not only having a great meal but a great overall experience. 

I highly recommend the Camellia Grill!"
745,qXhsamalKHWklYtCwKP03A,"Classic diner open since 1946. Had cheeseburger, Reuben sandwich and fries. One would think cooking a hamburger patty would be easy but any aficionado knows it's an art. Camellia Grill is on top of it! One of the best straight up, no gimmick burgers in town.

The only downside: Our server, Marvin and his endless, patronizing tourist banter and Louis Armstrong riffs. It was a little hard on my hangover."
746,D6SljIck3h1h-9vgKku7kQ,"Lady working the register was on her cell phone laughing and chatting with someone who clearly wasn't a customer. Didn't give us the time of day. She eventually said ""yeah yeah I'm listening"" but it was unclear if she was talking to us or her friend on the phone because there was zero eye contact or acknowledgement that were standing there waiting. We just put money down and left. Good food and fun atmosphere but embarrassingly unprofessional."
747,kSnxMBVM2TGBrxK368qkAA,"We stumbled by this place after taking the St. Charles Trolley/Bus to view the nice houses and park along St. Charles. We hopped off the bus and there it was with a long line outside. Long lines either mean great food or stupid tourists, so we hopped onto the line and looked for reviews. Since it had pretty great reviews and the line was only about 30 people long, we stayed put. Not sure how long we waited, but it was probably about 30-45 minutes. Once inside, you wait a bit longer on a couch where you are tortured by all the delicious smells. Once seated at the counter, you are handed a menu and water and they scribble your order off a checklist which you later use to pay your bill at the register. We got the hamburger and roast beef po' boy and both were delish. We shared chili cheese fries which were also great. They forgot our shakes so we didn't get them until nearly the end of the meal so we had to take them to go. In turning the cup over to dump it into the to-go cup, the waiter spilled mine all over and didn't offer to make a new one which was uncool but I really didn't need to drink all that anyway! I didn't think this place was worth the trip away from the quarter but if you are in the area, give it a try. (I believe I read they have a sister place in the quarter anyway.)"
748,wwaXXDsGE45LsDYi2euVCQ,"I will stop by Camellia Grill when I'm heading home from hearing great music at The Maple Leaf. It can be either crowded or not but the people who work here make my experience fun and engaging. They make me feel that we have been life-long ""brahs"" and treat me and my order as such. 

The menu is your typical dinner-style food; ranging from breakfast omelets to Hamburger and fries. I highly suggest ordering a chocolate milkshake as it pairs really well with the salty food you're about to consume. 

The food is good, the people are engaging, and the atmosphere has character."
749,4YwxKq-TBB_81yLem4vt1w,"It's not the same as I remember it but that's ok, I had a good eat & the people that are there are so nice & friendly, I'll be back some day."
750,Sbi6qVLJ7ur5h6HkwlcE1A,"good food and friendly service.  we got there just in time when the line was still short.  we got breakfast, eggs, grits, bacon, really basic stuff and it was good. I loved the way they make their hash browns.  Even though they were super busy, they were so friendly and sweet."
751,GWS84R8TZvl6U6qSHUWXAg,"Got the chili cheese fries recommended by the chef- because I wasn't able to finish a full order
Made room for my pecan pie!

Friend got the catfish po'boy and the fish was gooood! Nice crisp with a melt in your mouth fish, get this!!! Best po'Boy from our entire visit in Nola!

Hash browns are different here! Must be lathered in butter because it was soft and melt in my mouth, it looks like grits but it's so good!

I love that the seatings is around a bar stool area, old school diner feel. Definitely like it here!"
752,DoGG-xR2KQdhOPSxg79mvw,Dirty place. Cash only.  Greasy food.  Chile for chile cheese fries comes out of a can.
753,CczXsFBPLrXAAQ36NN7EAg,"I love this little diner, from the servers to the cooks to the food, everything was great. The only seating is pretty much at the bar so you can watch them prepare your food. They have a system going on in the kitchen and they all work so well together. The menu is extensive and everything looks so good it was hard to choose. 
Ultimately, I went with a simple breakfast of bacon, eggs, grits and toast. I mean you can't go wrong with that. The Manhattan omelet was really good and the serving size is massive. 
As you  an imagine it gets very busy so we enjoyed our food in a timely manner then left so others can enjoy as well."
754,ixLwtYIaO1k_5d6ClfNI-w,"First, this no diet joint. With that said, they are open late and the perfect place for a late night, post drinking evil food of decadence, I can't believe I'm eating this but it is so good kinda place. Which leads me to the chili cheese omelette. Super fluffy eggs filled with cheese and smothered in a mild but tasty chili with beans, served with a generous portion of hash browns. I know what your thinking- heartburn on a plate. Yet, surprisingly, not the case. Trust me!"
755,ARRDyzhxkU01XVUK-VdECA,"Great diner just off Chartres St. It was busy and the seating is two U shaped counters but the food and service was excellent. We did have to wait a little but they moved the crowd pretty quickly.My husband and I had an omelette and pancakes, and the food was good, omelet was cooked soft, I like it that way but I know some who prefer a more firm egg. Coming from the east coast, it is hard to impress us with diner food, but this was a nice change from the coffee and pastries breakfast we had the day before."
756,ZJhljDRfbrW1or8td9l5Wg,"this was one of the best places to eat pre-katrina. it was close enough to the tulane campus to walk, but far enough that most people were too lazy. there was never really a line. sometimes a 5 or 10 minute wait if we had a lot of people. the food was incredible and the atmosphere was perfect. 

now, though, there are lines for hours. the few times i have been back, they've been so concerned with moving customers in and out that the food just doesnt have ""it"" anymore. and i'll be darned if i spend 2 hours waiting in line for a lunch counter."
757,LCHALAjzxgTACR49DRK_zg,The food is okay the young lady at the door is not sure what her job is the restroom is very dirty and all the floors are very dirty. The server was very nice all of them .I will come back after the place is clean up
758,Xn5HuT15Sf7XBAeUQOgY-w,"Haven't been here since I was 12 in 1982.  Still remember the delicious pecan waffles.  They did not disappoint.  Enjoyed visiting with our waiter, Dennis.  He suggested the hot apple pie.  Heated on the flat top with ice cream!   Delicious."
759,NdZhVbRSBMXNQpuAKQXnBQ,"While this is definitely one of the more touristy restaurants in this part of town, Camellia Grill is consistently delicious and a frequent stop for me.

It has a true diner feel, using only a curved bar with stools rather than tables, which adds to a fun experience (but may present problems for people with disabilities, as the stools aren't particularly comfortable and can put strain on people's backs). The waiters behind the bar are very friendly and social. The food is always great, especially the burgers. I have never been disappointed with a meal here.

The only downside is that the restaurant smells a little funky sometimes, but it's not enough to ruin the experience."
760,PgIpS9ddtpPa8cEFth7upA,"Adorable place with outstanding service. 

This place is a blast from the past and authentically so. I really loved getting to sit at the counter while having my freeze. I've never had a freeze before, but it's akin to a milkshake, only it might be better. 

Everyone treated me like royalty here and all I got was a freeze and a piece of pie to go. 

I hope they never change (it sounds like they haven't!) and I plan on stopping back in on my next trip to NOLA."
761,Fvfp0OP-UxUnJDBDFpKWMw,"Anyone who doesn't give this place 5 stars is someone who doesn't understand New Orleans, and someone you shouldn't be friends with.

The food is unbelievable and the atmosphere is unquestionably Nola.  There is no better place on earth to fill your belly the morning after you've had a great New Orleans night."
762,sWdasfU5uukcI1YSaZ9iBg,"Old New Orleans diner. Sit at the bar service, which is excellent.  Great food.  Large portions. Staff is very interactive, friendly and funny.  Our group of four was seated in ten minutes and served shortly after ordering.  Mexican omelette, chili/cheese omelette, waffle and fried chicken and The Word sandwich were all great. Fun experience."
763,c3zElUVZ-VUi01iNX4Nq2A,"This is a must visit if you're in New Orleans/ uptown. The service is absolutely out of this world. You will immediately be greeted with charismatic, southern charm as soon as you walk in. The food is amazing as well, it's exactly what you want to eat on your cheat day. I suggest either the chilli cheese dog, chilli cheese fries or waffle. The bacon is great too! Ask for it extra crispy"
764,jdJwIGeW0th_5F2C3B1vlA,"Camellia should the first place on anyone's list wanting to get some true southern feel good food--burgers, fries, steak, shakes, heck even omelettes. I am fortunate enough to live close by, so camellia is a regular occurrence for me, breakfast, lunch or dinner! Keep em comin baaby."
765,Uft2P8vMeZB8bJvK9pzEag,"Delicious food. Absolutely add the chili on everything. Service was great and staff were super friendly. The wait was pretty long and I'm not sure I'd come back again, but everyone should try it out at least once. It sort of felt like travelling back in time."
766,OFLI4fzr7Y2DJdCj_HMB1A,"I met my future wife here in 1987, so we were excited to return for some nostalgia.  Our marriage has fared far better than this restaurant.  Dirty.  Unfriendly.  Lazy staff that yammered on and on and on (loudly) with each other about how much they were unappreciated by management. Much cursing.  Pie was hot on the bottom, refrigerator cold on top. Wish we had just driven by - this was not the kind of memory that we want to relive."
767,24RmD4N7x2UguIrpLY8W7Q,I've been going here for 50 years without a second thought. My recent visit was disappointing. I'm sorry to report the staff was different. I enjoyed the surly waiters and friendly banter...gone on this visit. The food was the same as always. I'll give another visit a long pause.
768,o4WttS5wq6ZMk_uvEHmc-A,Came here while on vacation because I was told it's a must! It was packed which was a good sign so it took us about 20 minutes to get seated but the host was very kind and attentive and tried his best to get us seated as quickly as possible. Once we were seated the wait for the food wasn't long at all! And the food was delicious. Not anything extraordinary just regular diner food but sooooo good. Cured my hangover haha!
769,fYAgjAtuor547YTrXTZG1Q,"I get here and see we're supposed to wait for half an hour or more for a stool at a greasy-spoon style lunch counter. No way that's worth it, right? Well, the egg on my face was both literal and figurative. The food was hands down the best breakfast diner food I've ever had. The omelettes, in particular, are extraordinary (I know, I was wishing I had ordered one while eating my still-perfectly-delicious club sandwich). They do things pretty old-school here, with plenty of salt, fat, and cheese where appropriate. I think the fries are actually fried in beef tallow (YUM!).

The service could not be friendlier. Seriously, they couldn't be. They're at maximum friendliness. If they were any more engaged and talkative and happy to chat, it would start feeling awkward.

The decor's pretty much non-existent, you just look right at the cooks and the griddles, which is part of the charm. Everything's affordable."
770,2wNPJ0sH9XBrb7uvsjiUdQ,"We came here at 9:30 AM on Saturday since the furniture store we were heading to wasn't open until 10, to get a breakfast and kill some time. The line was short (or so we thought) until we had waited 15 minutes, to get inside, to sit down and wait for a while longer. Compared to some of the other times since, however, when we've passed by, our wait was clearly nothing. 

""This better be worth it!,"" two of us kept telling our third friend, who assured us it was. And when we sat down at the counter, surrounded by large blonde tourists, and were greeted by Marvin, oh, we knew it would be. 

The staff, as has been said, is what makes this place what it is. I noticed when paying that there was a framed photograph of Camellia before their reopening, and the entire front was covered in post-it notes wishing the owners and workers well. Marvin took care of us and he was so funny and charming, that we felt immediately welcomed. Every other waiter in the place was the same, joking with the clientele, being incredibly attentive, and welcoming in their own ways. 

I'd read already that this was THE classic diner spot; what I did not realize until I walked in, was that it was the atmosphere, the camaraderie of the staff, and the excellent food, that made it so.

My two dining companions decided to split a Mexican omelette, with jalapenos on the side because one of them can't handle spice. This was clearly a good decision, because we saw the full omelettes being plopped down in front of people and they were RIDICULOUS. The Mexican omelette was scrambled with ground beef and bell peppers, and came with a side of fries. It looked pretty good but I was too distracted to try some...

I ordered a cheeseburger, dressed with lettuce, tomato, and mayo, and a side of fries. The burger patty was hand formed and the buttery bun was incredibly soft; my mouth had no problem sinking into every bite, savoring the taste of the beef, cheese, and other accoutrements. You know it's annoying when you can't fit a whole burger and taste everything in each bite. The fries, however, were a tad limp and disappointing.

We finished out with a slice of pecan pie. Now, I do NOT like sweets. I am simply not a dessert person. But this pie was out of this world. It was so buttery and SAVORY, with a hint of sweetness. The pecans had been chopped into smaller pieces, so each morsel had soaked in the sweet taste of the syrup. It was topped with a rich vanilla ice cream that melted into each bite. The crust was my favorite part, thin and again, tasting of pure butter, with a wonderfully creamy texture. 

The next day, still not knowing where to get food, I called in to get a burger and fries to-go. I walked in past the tourists 20 minutes after calling, picked up my take-out bag, and paid $9 including a tip. In and out in 5 minutes. The fries this time were much crisper and the burger was just as delicious. This will probably continue to be my option when I want the food, and not the wait.

(Edit: I pondered a bit and then decided that not only because the food and staff were so great, but that this is the first NOLA spot that I feel is going to be a staple, they deserve a 5-star review)."
771,jGGNbzumba4Ac0CWB2qKsw,"I'm from LA and the times I've come to New Orleans I always make sure I stop to by to grab a bite.

Camellia Grill is the one spot you have to stop at to get the true feeling of a diner. As soon as you walk in the seats are there and you see them making the food. The food is super affordable, the servers and staff are friendly and fast to get you your food. I will definitely say you must try the shakes...BOMB. Whether you have breakfast at 9AM or 11PM, you have to go to Camellia Grill."
772,NZiNNIg1hth5LA5Jvr8JlQ,"Camellia Grill is a New Orleans standard that has weathered the test of time. It has become one of the most popular ""greasy spoon joints"" in town, and mostly by word of mouth.

Product: Breakfest foods, just about any time of the day or night. They are on par with other similar establishments, with fare such as pancakes, bacon, eggs, and the like. The portions are large and filling. 3 stars

Service: One sits at the service bar or one of the small tables in the establishment. It is nearly always busy in here, so expect a wait, either seated or standing. The staff is super-friendly, but they are over-whelmed by the clientele. Food is made-to-order and piping hot from the grill. 3 stars

Facilities: The restaurant sits in the River Bend, and there is no dedicated parking, so you'll have to either be extremely lucky to get one of the few spots right on the end of South Carrollton or park back in the neighborhood, unless you take a cab, walk, bike, or take the street car, which stops right at the turn of Carrollton and St. Charles. The storefront is your typical mid-20th Century breakfast joint. There is very little room inside, so try to go when it isn't so busy (or, at least the weather is nice outside), because there can be quite the wait. Inside was fairly clean, but (as noted earlier) the staff can be overwhelmed, and old plates can still be at the counter when one sits. 2 stars

Bonus: Extended late-nite hours.

Overall: This place is typical of restaurants that receive buzz in New Orleans--packed to the gills, slowed service, and higher prices (supply and demand economics are heavily in play). If you happen to be touring the city and take the Uptown street car line, it may be a place you want to check out, but there's nothing really special, unique, or ""New Orleans"" about the place. Just realize that because of the current popularity, it is often very busy. 3 stars"
773,9FufRrDRrCLonkBiaXEMJA,"The best experience in NOLA. If you have never been here it's a must! I was here 25 years ago and couldn't wait to come back! The food is the best diner you will ever go to...but it's not all about he food...what makes it soooo special is the people! Not just the staff they are extraordinary no doubt, but it's the locals that share their stories at every table with you! No matter who you are or where your from or when you go...there's a story to be had! I will NEVER forget this place!"
774,9U7XvPbeqm2FjE2FqocKRw,"Camellia Grill is a little piece of New Orleans history.  Expect great food at low prices.  The portion sizes are
 very large!  You cannot go wrong with a cheeseburger and an order of fries.  It's so good and juicy that I often get it plain....or plain and add an egg.  The omelets and milk shakes are also excellent.  Don't expect to see a clean work area, as the employees are so busy working that grill, it's kind of at the bottom of their lists."
775,OVfFMEHm42JvDXnHMY4S1w,"I returned here late night on 4/18/08. It looked like a different staff than they have had for years--I heard they changed owners. Only other difference is I thought they used to be open 24 hrs and now they close at 2am--we just made it. Maybe they were tired cause we were at the very end of the day, as there wasn't the usual hoopla screaming back and forth at the grill, but the food is still amazing. This time I went big and got an omelet with everything in it and topped chili. YUM YUM give me some. Also tried a bit of the burger which just melt in my mouth. 

The original review below is still accurate as well. :-)

____Original Review___
My favorite diner in the country hands down. What's not to like about a small place with a U-shaped seating area where the waiters yell out orders old-school style? It's like you stepped into the past of how things used to be. Every time we go here we have an awesome experience. Getting to it via the streetcar is just the beginning of all of the fun.

I love watching them cook on that HUGE flattop grill. You're in New Orleans so everything is served with a huge amount of butter--from the omelets to the pies. Even the butter for patrons is in a HUGE canister. Our waiter told us they used to be smaller but then people here complained. :-O

Food highlights:
- Omelets: My favorite omelet ever--I usually just get the denver and it's fantastic. They have such flavor (probably from the grease and butter but hey, you're probably on vacation). They are quite huge but OH so satisfying. Get it with fries--how many places do you get fries and breakfast food?
- Chocolate pecan pie: Another best ever. It's thin but packed full of flavor. My friend said he didn't want any but I ordered one anyway and he wouldn't give it back to me! Watch them prepare it--take the pie out of the tin, slap it on the grill upside down, pour a heck of a lot of melted butter on top, flip it over and put it on a plate with ice cream on top. Oh man, I'm having strong cravings just talking about it!
- Chili cheese fries: A crispy, gooey, tasty delight. You can even get a chili cheese omelet which sounds awesome, but I haven't gone there quite yet.

Perfect place to get a great diner meal either at the end of your night or the beginning of your day."
776,dIwcOt-66QeQzb5ozTQ8Gw,"I just got back from my first trip to New Orleans with a friend of mine who knows it like the back of her hand. She took me to this restaurant.  This was by far one of the very best experiences I had all weekend! It was nothing short of pure southern charm. Stepping off the streetcar, seeing this little place for the first time, stepping inside - it was really neat. But the best is the food and friendly, attentive service here. I had a flat-top burger, fries and a ""chocolate freeze""; not really knowing what that was and let me just assure you it was one of the best damn shakes I have ever consumed. The burger was the best (the best!) and my friend got an omelete which was about the length and circumfrence of her torso. The food alone would bring me back again and again if I lived closer, but what sealed the deal was the service. They were polite and charming and I felt like I had gone back in time. I marvel at the narrow-minded people below who gave it one or two stars. Sure - it's not the Palmer House or Everest (I'm a Chicago girl), therefore there will not be a dollop of foie gras and pine nut greens or peruvian beechnut-saffron infused foam on your hamburger and if that's what those people require from every restaurant they grace with their presence then I'm not sure why they even walked in the front door to begin with. The food is not overly greasy and certainly not overpriced by any means. It's everything you hope you'd find at an old-school, classic diner and when I can get back to New Orleans it will be one the first places / things on my list!"
777,lFJ6AKYzIqpioJobGYCK8w,This was one of the cleanest and  best places in town until the present owners took over.  A New Orleans institution dyeing for the locals right before our eyes.  I guess the tourists and college kids won't know any better.
778,l6enoWAn-jKpdjuYBPikrQ,"Always great here


We love coming here and it's great to meet locals. 

We always recommend the chocolate shake

Pecan waffle 

Only late nite place that's a local treasure"
779,X--IL7fh5w890eqC3E5a8g,"Perfect dinner! Better than I Hop, Waffles House.. etc. exactly what you would expect from a local dinner! Walked in 5 minutes of it being packed and had our food! Very fast service!"
780,P1DrmqqvioYIIVT88X3qww,"Best grits on Earth, hands down! Quick, ultra-professional service, tasty food, and a really, really cool building! What's not to love!? Make this a breakfast pit-stop on your next trip to New Orleans--you won't be disappointed!"
781,hdj7qJBmQ07zQZy4kyHLKQ,"I've been here before and had to take my kids again to the iconic hamburger bar. But sadly, I was grossed out. The server who took our order, also bussed the table, and brought us drinks, also made my salad with his hands- no tongs for the lettuce or the tomato Or gloves!! It was gross. And the number of times he wiped his hands on his pants... then to be extra grossed out, you should head to the bathroom where a mouse trap was set with PB! Omg! 6 of us ate there and it's the last time... if we get sick, we know where!"
782,f8aElWEYPRqqM04n4yzEMQ,"Awesome place! Very attentive and the food was fantastic. Pecan pie was the greatest I've ever had! Wife and I will be back on our next visit NOLA!!!

Ron! It is my pleasure to give you 10 stars. I just asked the wife before we head out, what was the hosts name? He was fantastic! Asked if we minded moving to the corner as there was a foursome coming in. We loved him! Wish we had people in CT that pleasant! Can't wait to come back pal!!"
783,TBgDZRDzZGIqXyCR_ePtMg,"Well we went here about 20 years ago and had fond memories of taking the trolley to get here.  Then a line to get in then some great food. And memorable service. This time there was no line and the place definitely felt aged and worn out.  We had lunch, po boys and burgers. They were all very good. Nothing special. I think breakfast is by far the best bet so if you go lower your expectations and eat breakfast dishes and try the pies.  Service was good as expected. It's a tiny place and nostalgic. A nice little diner style that seems to have staying power. Only counter service. If I went back to NO I would go somewhere else.  There are many better eating places in the garden district area.  But if it's your first time it's worth a try."
784,AQDgeP612H82v3W8MQr4JA,"If you want to keep it simple, this is the place. We ordered cheeseburgers and chocolates freeze. Fantastic flat grill cooked burger. Sometimes the simplest go to food is all it takes. Fries very crispy and fried green tomatoes are perfect. 
     You need to get there early or catch them at the right time. There is limited seating but worth the wait. I have yet to try the pies. But I hear they are to die for. My family and I have visited 3 times already and will be back. This is a must try place"
785,sk2QjZNKplJiJW8661-6AQ,"We had a nice breakfast here of bacon, grits, eggs, and toast. I'm a lover of breakfast food so after hearing about this place I had to try. It was an average meal.  Nothing overwhelming, but I would like to try lunch here also.  The staff was polite and laid back."
786,Nw8rdWAgvokerKUrJfE-FA,"The Camellia Grill was by far the best meal I had in N'awlins.  This is a great breakfast spot for a lightly cooked omelette and slice of pecan pie.  The price was very reasonable and the service was excellent.  I immediately got respect from ""sleepy"" and the rest of the African American staff when I told them I was from the Detroit area.  The pecan pie with a scoop of ice cream was unreal. (even for breakfast!)  I will definitely be back!"
787,zIgrZplaBA7yeDLdmwIkNg,We LOVE this place for a great pecan waffle!!   We frequently come here after church and rarely wait for a long time.  I just don't like the seating arrangement because it's hard to bring my infant now.  Always a favorite for me and my husband!!
788,aNjBLGcBuYs2uEDqMcIfEw,"I lived in New Orleans for three years & left in 2000 before Katrina took out much of the city. While I lived there, Camellia Grill was a regular stop almost every weekend & any time anyone came to visit. I was so thrilled to return to Camellia Grill on a recent visit & find that the original charm is still there, along with the amazing food & some of the original staff. I was amazed to see Michael & Marvin behind the counter & that they actually remembered me by name! I savored every bite of my Chef's Special Omelet & every sip of the yummy Chocolate Cream.

If you're ever in New Orleans, do yourself a huge favor & take the picturesque 15 min Street Car ride down St. Charles from the French Quarter to Cameilla Grill, you won't be disappointed with the entire experience!"
789,8IuGFYNrCYrXIrvN7Xy0HA,It had been years since I've been to Camellia Grill so recently I made my way back there.  I was lucky that it was during the week so we did not have any wait time.  The hardest thing to do was put money in the parking meter.  I ordered the pancakes not a big omelet person.  It was a basic pancake nothing fancy but Camellia Grill is not fancy it's been around for a long time and walking in is like walking back in time the restaurant has not changed a bit including the counter service.  If you go in the summer on weekends be prepared to wait outside in the heat.  It's also a great late night place after a night of drinking in the city.
790,q3DqGk2De7GojUe89WUHsA,"I've reviewed my fair share of places on yelp and I think I can count on one hand how many 5-star locations get my vote.  Let's be honest when you come C grill, its because your starving and drunk and you know you're going to be both in the morning if you don't just grab some good food before you crash.  

Well rest assured even when you don't read the menu properly and order something that you'd didn't intend, if the chefs at Camellia grill can help it they will.  

This place gets 5 from me because they care when they don't have to and their patrons honestly prob wouldn't remember the next day.  

I love this city."
791,Rsa3ujWfmx-XhjlG61YDJw,I always get the chef special omelet I have been for at least 10 years I usually eat here after a long night of work and it's usually the morning shift definitely my favorite shift to go in all the servers are super nice most of them have their pictures on the wall cuz they've been working there over 20 years definitely a must eat breakfast place in New Orleans there might be a couple of mediocre reviews but I've never ever had a problem with their food or service five stars all around for me
792,yPSbrUnup97q4ZKrL0OdoA,"Tl;dr A classic American diner -- I don't really see the hype, especially since the butter isn't real and is too liberally applied

FOOD: I ordered the hash browns and chef's special omelette. Contrary to most of the reviews here, I found the hash browns to have way too much of a butter flavor, although they did have a decent crisp. On my way to the bathroom I saw that this flavor was likely produced from the ButterIt, liquid butter alternative container I saw on the shelf. While this is significantly cheaper for the restaurant, I personally think there's a big difference in flavor between this and real butter. The omelette was good -- drizzled in chili and beans and cheese. Nothing special but solid. The one scoop chocolate shake was just okay. I expected a creamy milkshake, but be aware that it seems to be ice cream and ice crushed together so it'll be a icy to sip on. I tried my friend's coleslaw and it wasn't acidic enough and had a little too much liquid. It's really not bad, it's just the standout place I hear hyped about either.

RESTROOMS: Another reviewer commented that the walk there smelled like sewage -- I totally disagree. It was clean and organized, all cans and containers well labeled and put away. 

SERVICE: Good, they take care of you at the counter! You'll take the order paper the servers marks up for you and pay at the register in the front. You can tip at the register or leave cash at the counter."
793,KYjwGWsfMqUh-YcnvjVSKg,Hubby and I are back at it !!!!!! Service and food was good .Quick bite to eat for lunch . Burgers was cooked to perfection .  Such a Beautiful Day . Burgers was just in time to get what they deserve!!!!  Nothing like good food .
794,QTLbW7f20wU6u9l6TcxnIA,You really need to visit this place when in New Orleans. The best time to go I think is late at night . You can get burgers or breakfast or a good milk shake. We got burgers with fries this visit. Great late night place . Don't miss this stop!!!!
795,Hwnj5WaWDZWMlPP2znRbkg,It's a greasy diner and my husband and I love it. The food is cheap and satisfying. It's an iconic diner. I hope it's there every time we visit New Orleans.
796,N0-s7s16uVW2IyEX_jCd0A,Have you ever wanted to watch a short order cook make a eight different omelettes all at the same time on the same girl? Well you can do it here!
797,R6X0HlLwUEVnt7fn_-Rpig,"Love it!  A time capsule of an old-fashioned diner with incredibly fast friendly  service. Great omelettes. Have not tried any other dishes but I hear the Grille does it all with pizzaz. If you are in New Orleans, take the time to chow down at the Grille!"
798,Ah7Qo4nLiAecGVWHElEu0Q,"There might be a line, but try anyway. Diner-counter style set up for a quick turnover. Would not recommend for a group larger than two without a long wait. Breakfast was delicious, cheese bacon mushroom omelette and hashbrowns. Sadly, grits only served between 8 AM and 11 AM. Definitely recommend."
799,tRWIa8Mlnu8YZFsY1L06oA,I was highly recommended to come here for breakfast and I am so happy I did! It's very small and very quaint but I assure you that the service is top-notch. If you are not sure what to eat please ask the servers and they will guide you. The portions are extremely generous and the prices are on point. The food is phenomenal and I swear I could not eat another morsel until dinner. definitely a well-known staple here in New Orleans and I will definitely come back on my next visit.
800,XzgvzxXTb5WaNTnLCUyIfQ,"Remember eating at your friendly neighborhood lunch counter?  Neither do I.  That is why I enjoy eating at The Camellia Grill.  It's like going back in time.  Everyone sits on a stool at the lunch counter and watches your food being prepared.  For about twenty bucks, the three of us ate pancakes, bacon and eggs for lunch.  We even took some home.  Leave your diet at home and enjoy favorites like pancakes, hamburgers, tuna salad, a bowl of gumbo, or go straight to the pecan pie a la mode.  It's all good.  Tourists can make a day out of it by riding the St. Charles Streetcar down St. Charles Avenue, checking out some amazing scenery, and stopping at The Camellia Grill for a little nostalgia.  Long live New Orleans and long live The Camellia Grill!"
801,WIlfeHHBDExE81YGCZMCtw,By far one of my favorite places to grab a hamburger or an omelette for breakfast. Staff is always courteous and the wait is never too long. Be sure to get the mocha freeze and a slice of pecan pie for desert. Special thanks to Will who has always been gracious to us for the better part of 15 years.
802,y6yv3MAM0vY_0DWJb039WQ,"A very fun lunch spot.  Set up with seat yourself counters, this place has a fun vibe.  Service was good and the waiters were very entertaining.  The food was super tasty and VERY affordable.  The chocolate freeze hit the spot on a hot summer day.  All in all, a good place for a quick lunch."
803,pbY49WxkqseoxibvuaNfYA,Chefs special omelette was amazing came within 5 minutes of my order. The Banana pie was fire too
804,r0nk4WYlGmcXG7U1BTixFA,"Sooooo GOOD! I never have had a milkshake at breakfast, but darn, I will again! The atmosphere is what makes the place. I really enjoyed my time there and think you will too!"
805,RlG9JXpgyIIbHPlDIQbsCA,"I love Camellia Grill!!! this place represents New Orleans so well.  The staff is so fun and friendly, and the food is simply delicious.  

I love this place so much because you can come here any time of the day.  i mean, who doesn't like breakfast at 10 pm? or who doesn't want a juice burger or a mouthwatering omelet after a heavy night of Nola style drinking?

Ive tried the burger with bacon and cheese, and the turkey omelet, the mushroom omelet, and the plain cheese omelet.  Basically any omelet you want they will be happy to make.  I can never decide whether to go for the fries or the hash browns, both are fantastic.   

And this place has the best milkshakes in town! if you come here you cannot leave without one! Trust me you will thank me!

Coming into this dinner just makes my day.  The atmosphere is great and the food is even better.  Sometimes the line is really long, but it is certainly worth the wait.  when mu brother came to visit him i took him here and he just wants to come back only for the food! it is THAT good!!"
806,UYFpHineQdq2-4OLHPg7VA,"I love, love, love this place. The space is so cute and quaint. I love the counter and how you can watch them make your meal in front of you. Our waiter was super attentive and a great conversationalist. My mom and I both ordered the shrimp omelette. I added spinach to mine. This is a charming little place that is a quintessential model of New Orleans style. If I am ever in the area it is mandatory that I stop in for breakfast, definitely on my list of favorites."
807,ODLvJqKgnRFkPUjKPqPSdw,"If you want great food, the best service, and all around a good time come to camellia and you will have 10/10 on all three of these and prices are really reasonable"
808,p0ejYn3BWqpYhRLav3hmpQ,"Great service and amazing food!! Ordered the waffle and bacon! Omg!!! I could eat that over and over!! Definitely will come back!! Great people working there.  Not to mention the cook, got the order without writing the order!!"
809,nwSMMjX9GkSTtBc4p9zBKg,"This place was delicious and service was great! 

My husband had the special, which is huge but delicious. Two ppl could probably share this. I had the eggs with sausage and hash browns. Although simple it was all well made! 

Loved it"
810,jmCQntGxZIspvelGFo2GCg,"Best ""Breakfast"" burger everrr! Thanks, Will for being awesome! I ordered the bacon cheese burger, and added fried egg and syrup. Mmmmm!"
811,_7R0jIPu76yhjarF7Ho8BA,This little gem in uptown reminds me of a Waffle House. The service was superb & fast! As soon as we sat down we were helped without a problem. I ordered the bacon omelette. My mom ordered an egg white veggie omelette. My sister ordered the shrimp omelette. They all come with shredded hashbrowns and they didn't skimp on the meat at all (like some places do!) try this place if you want to. It's about $12 Lyft ride one way from the convention center.
812,_ciWoOo34umEfDBcDX9B_A,"One of the many fantastic historic staples of this city's dining experience. 

Greasy spoon food, breakfast all day/night, one of the city's best burgers and warm and entertaining service. Hard to beat. 

In my travels to New Orleans, I find myself at their Quarter location more often but it was such a pleasure to visit the original. Since 1946 and still going strong."
813,_aydk0bheLQdXziSbPKkLg,"Love this place. I love breakfast and I love this unpretentious, eat-at-the-counter, greasy spoon. Love that all of the orders are taken by call, no written tickets. The ice is that amazing crushed ice. I still dream about their omelettes. It's like their pancake batter and egg/omelette batter got mixed together. It's light and fluffy and delicious."
814,nU9oMt3FPCQBqJXLxV4wpA,"Always good friendly service. Nothing fancy, just good omelettes and other food. Good for breakfast anytime of day.  Counter seating only, it is nice, just a heads up."
815,OHuCsjr-w7vdlCvWXAUACQ,"This place is like home away from home for us we eat here so much while visiting New Orleans. We came here every morning for bfast last October while visiting and on this years visit we came here for bfast AND for our late night post drinking munchies. Incredible food for a great price and you have to try the chocolate freeze everyone is raving about. I'm having chocolate freeze withdrawals now that we're back home! FYI - according to my scientific research, this food is the best remedy for curing a hangover. You're welcome."
816,b-QU00pHM9UYsGHbVvXbkg,"On the advice of a friend who is also a local, we jumped on the Green Trolly at Canal St and rode it to the end of St. Charles with the sole purpose of ending up at The Camellia Grill.  

The trolley ride is a nice mini-adventure of its own and we were fortunate to have perfect weather and very little company on the way out.  

The diner is a small step back in time as you walk through the doors. All counter seating at wide marble tops. The staff is decked out in white hats and white coats with bow ties. 

We were lucky to have Vernell as our waiter. He is a phenomenal individual currently in the right place for his personality. Funny and always smiling he interacted with all his guests with a genuine friendliness of a southern gentleman.  

The food is prepared diner-style right on the flat top with no frills and very quickly. My Harry's Special Po Boy and my wife's Shrimp Po Boy where both excellent and the chili-cheese fries very good as well.  I finished the meal with a piece of apple Vernell tossed on the flattop to heat then topped with ice cream to round off a perfect meal experience.  

Highly recommend you wander to the end of St Charles and experience this place yourself."
817,v4J9G4pT9FbSEtoRpFQkXQ,"I've been coming here for over 30 years. And it is awesome. There are so many things I love. If you come one a week or once a year, you feel right at home. It's all counter seating. And let me tell you. In 30 years nothing has changed. Everything is cooked on the grill in front of you. I'll tell you a few of my favorites. The eggs are awesome. Especially scrambled with cheese. Their French fries are awesome. Tip. You can get cheese fries or chili cheese fries. But by far, their cheeseburger is the best. It is yummy perfection. I know there are lots of food options in New Orleans. But the Grill is not to be missed!"
818,36xGA_wWE1shtwhXIgF14A,Very mediocre food..Maybe back in the day it was something to rant and rave about but now it's totally not worth it
819,5JNxFW_y6lFUtpm6VNqUsA,"I go here often because I live in the neighborhood. But DONT ever make the mistake of getting food to go. Every single time I order takeout they just can't seem to get it right. So this time, I checked the order before leaving and OF COURSE it wasn't right. They re-did my burger and I assumed since it was the second time they had to make it, I wouldn't have to check it. Took it home and would you believe this incompetent idiots got it wrong AGAIN???? I mean how hard is it to write down what I say to you IN PeRSON...wasn't even a phone order....I said it to the waiter's face. If you can't understand English, get out of the damn country or work somewhere where language isn't needed. I love going to this place but will never get takeout there ever again.  People that work here shouldn't be in the service industry serving people."
820,uxqG6NwjdqWU-rw_c__d6Q,"Ordered a burger for pick up two days after they reopened. They where still trying to figure out how things where going to work. Sorry don't remember name of burger I usually order. But not what it was before Covid. They now require we include a side like fries, rings or salad.  Look forward to thins getting sorted out. Also what appeared to be college students came in with no masks even though clearly posted that masks must be worn. They did not inforce. I am sure things will get better. I will be back."
821,in9KEWdTQn3y4-9Ufj79mQ,Great service and food! Had the one eye buck burger and Mac bits definitely a great greasy spoon diner that hits the spot.
822,uWoDPaLhSL9babR8T4URHg,"The woman host was so nice, felt like I was talking with my cousin. The waffles, pancakes, bacon and French fries are ""the best thing I have ever eaten for breakfast"" according to my daughter.
Mr. Michael was on point!!! He took our order, delivered our food and got us back out - happy and full. We recommend this to everyone. It's right off the St. Charles Street car line to S.Carrollton."
823,dFXjVrzKqEQySX3_BsmAwg,I had the Mexican Omelette which was ok but I could not get past the flies...so the one star.
824,W7x8QWvrInfzRMKwJrX80w,"I love Camellia Grill! I have been going here for years, and I have so many fond memories of this place.

Had to come here on my latest trip for breakfast, and luckily my friend was up for it. She had only eaten at the newer location down in the Quarter, but I told her it just wasn't the same as the original location.

First of all you get to take the street car all the way to Carrolliton Ave., so it's a nice way to see some of the grand homes on St. Charles Ave. in the Garden District. I've always loved doing that.

We arrived on a Sunday morning around 11:00, so I was braced for a line. I've always had to wait in line previously around this time, so I was shocked when we showed up, and there wasn't a line outside. There were about 8 people ahead of us waiting inside, but we only had to wait about 15 minutes for our spots at the counter.

Just know that there is only a counter here, that seats about 30 people or so, and that's part of the appeal. I've always liked that communal atmosphere, and pretty much always end up talking to whoever is sitting next to me. And the great thing about this place, is that it feels like more locals eat here, more so than tourists. I think a lot of people that come to New Orleans never leave the Quarter, which is a shame, but that's fine with me, because the less tourists here the better. I could be totally wrong, but every time I've been that's been the case.

My fav thing to order for breakfast has always been the waffle. I love waffles, and they make a mean one. I had that with a scrambled egg on the side and some bacon. If you like waffles, get that. You won't be disappointed. And get ready for this..... you won't get pats of butter to put on your waffle, they actually serve melted butter in one of those syrup dispensers. I have never seen that anywhere else. So you can pour your butter on first, then cover that with syrup. Messy and really, really good.

Another thing I'd highly recommend is a slice of pie a la mode. They heat the pie on the griddle, so it's nice and warm. My fav is pecan pie, but they have lots of other kinds. I haven't tried this in a while (way too full after my last breakfast), but leave some room for this if you like pie.

This has always been on of my fav spots in New Orleans, and since they've been around since 1946 and are still going strong, I hope they are around for another 70 years. Can't wait to come back the next time I'm visiting."
825,l1r5OtX_E98nPruXRC5bJg,"I hadn't been here in a long time but recently dined in.
I was suspect of the cleanliness and ""chefs"" lack of use of gloves when touching the food in plane site. I ordered a coke and as it was sitting on the counter by the server a female worker's long hair weave dropped into my drink then came out of my drink. It was served to me but I didn't touch it. She didn't realize it happened but I saw. Wondering how many other consumables have come into contact with this weave."
826,6HBcL1RQe0BmZ_9-30dE9g,"I decided to try a new restaurant in the area, big mistake. I walked in and sat down and waited several minutes even to get a menu. A group of young boys walked in after me and was waited on before me. I thought it was strange but didn't pay it any mind. I ordered a drink, and they gave it to me in a to-go cup, this was also strange because I had no intentions on placing a to go order. I let this go as well telling myself that maybe they were just out of cups. I ordered a burger with bacon, cheddar cheese and an egg on top along with an order of fries. I specifically told the man taking my order that I did not want mayo on my burger. I find mayo disgusting, and I always make sure to specify that I do not want that on my food. They prepare the food fast, so I do not have any complaints about that aspect of my experience at this restaurant. Once my food was ready it was placed in boxes and in a bag as if I had placed a to go order. I decided that I wouldn't make a big deal about this, so I paid for my food and left. Once I got home, I discovered multiple problems with my burger. For starters, the yolk from the egg was sitting in the bottom of the box making the bottom bun soggy, and it fell completely apart when I tried to pick the burger up. Never would I have ordered an egg on my burger if I wasn't planning on eating it there. The second problem I found with my burger was the fact that there was no bacon on it. The third problem was that the burger had American cheese and not cheddar. Lastly, this burger had mayo on it. I ended up throwing this overpriced burger out, and I was so angry I decided I needed to share my terrible experience with this resturant here​."
827,rPc0Bdmox4a6oxHruNMxdw,"Chocolate cherry freeze, please!

Okay, if you're a stickler for cleanliness, this is probably not your place. There are some not-so-perfect things going on in the food prep area that can't help but be noticed by a casual observer. If this is the kind of thing that bothers you, head somewhere else with a closed kitchen so you can't see what's going on behind closed doors. But me? I trust my digestive system, especially my acidic lil tum tum, to take care of whatever I might toss down my gullet and not fuss at me, and so far, it has been successful.

The food is tasty, the freezes are divine. They have a good gumbo and red beans; I had their chili cheese omelet and it was MASSIVE and delicious; I've brought a bunch of visitors here and they've all had solid meals, from fried catfish plates to hamburger po boys to muffalettas even.

Wait, can we talk about the freezes? OMG, I need to stop writing this review and get my butt down to Camellia Grill to get 1. Or 2. Or 12. Soooooo delicious and refreshing and wonderful. I love the chocolate cherry but any flavor will be awesome I'm sure. 

The best part has to be the experience, though. Sit at the counter, order from a jovial and boisterous server, watch your food being made...it's all good fun. A solid stop off the streetcar in the Riverbend."
828,wpr1edBxYXY57QAH7hc_uw,"Best place in the whole world! The burger was so good I came back the next day for another!! 
Staff and food are choice!! I love Camellia Grill!!!"
829,8baWxk6OsLkeUH59ZnBMBQ,"Classic and reliable. Always a must on every visit to NOLA. Right on the streetcar line, so great location in Riverbend area. Hasn't changed and hope it never will."
830,9PfKHTjg7Bnj5qtTWNyxEg,"YUM!! My mother lived uptown twenty years ago and referred us to this place for an awesome burger - she was right! Classic and delicious were the two words that came to mind. A cozy and friendly atmosphere was provided by the wait staff at the bar style seating. My party ordered chili cheese fries, fried green tomatoes, burgers, chicken strips, and mashed potatoes. Chili was homemade, fried green tomatoes had the most perfect light cornmeal breading, burgers were huge, chicken strips had a tasty breading, and the mashed potatoes included the peeling for extra flavor!! We'll definitely be back!"
831,ozxTHtKANZxx4rS5pVH3Gg,"I can't find enough good things to say about The Camellia Grill! One of my all time favorite places to grab a late night breakfast. The pecan waffle is one of the best I have ever had, and you won't find more friendly and caring staff anywhere else! I love bringing friends here and tell everyone I know who is visiting the city to make sure not to miss this one! Although at times it can get crowded and seating limited they move quickly and everyone is very friendly!!"
832,Sgv9TYSehRASvYLv78HEUg,Best lil greasy spoon in the N O. Chili cheese omelette a gem. Good place to eat casually.
833,yxLs7DiKX2JeR_PkI-okSw,"LOVE this diner. We went for breakfast a few years back (I have scoured the web to find the name of this grill since we will be returning next month). They serve up classic breakfast stuff (pancakes, omelettes, coffee) with some NOLA love and flavor. All the cooking is done right in front of you with adds to the charm of this diner. We loved our pecan waffles. Yum!  Now that I'm doing the KETO diet...gonna try the omelettes. Ha! 

Note that this is counter seating, which threw us off guard but our family was able to find a spot together."
834,9DhDd4uPpKEKVupIFOCbmA,"I've been coming here for 43 years and never have I had such a disgusting breakfast. Cold uncooked bacon, one half cup of coffee, grilled Swiss cheese sandwich came out as grilled American cheese, and bacon and cheese omelet brown on the outside yet uncooked in the center. I could understand if it was busy, but almost no wait for a seat. With all new good breakfast places in NOLA, this location will fare no better than the French Quarter location, closed. And for the record, this culinary disaster cost over $30. You have no idea how it distresses me to write this."
835,UK4HTC7iIEajqerC7kJdfQ,"Got the warm pie with ice cream on top and it was 1000000 (a million times) better than that over cooked nasty ravioli appetizer at the pizza kitchen.  The grill saves the day.  

And the breakfast po-boy looked killer from our guest that we met visiting from England.

For $7 the camellia grill pie and ice cream buries that nasty mushroom ravioli from the pizza  kitchen."
836,gPO6Hml2cjEhxGRwuQsTDQ,"If you're lucky enough to be in NOLA, hop on the streetcar and head down into the Garden District to The Camellia Grill.  Right at the corner of St. Charles & S Carrollton, it looks like a charming old home from the outside, but once you're in, you'll think you've stepped back in time to a '50's diner, complete with chrome countertops and cooks in white caps.   Their burgers are the best in town, and the chocolate pecan pie will make you get down on your knees and kiss the feet of the man who served it to you!   The guys at the counter will keep you entertained, and are more than happy to share the history of the place along with a few jokes (some of which may be at your expense).  I've been to NOLA many times, and this is one place that I go back to every single visit.  When my daughter came for the first time, I had to take her here just to get a piece of that pie...now she's hooked too! 

Ask for Mike, he'll take good care of you!"
837,8ADYtA6EENKIgqMDwD5g7A,"Forget about the fries I mentioned previously and go straight to those delicious burgers!! I got tired of staring at all the burger pics on their Yelp page and got one of my own!! I ordered the bacon cheeseburger. It was cooked to perfection, still very juicy and flavorful. The cheese was extra melty and  the bacon was crispy not burnt ! I will be back for the burger alone. 

Side note:tried the basic breakfast (eggs and grits). Eggs were cooked well nothing special and the grits were pretty good as well."
838,zFzw-1JnHV-yl0F3mmX7lg,"This morning I got a Rano's omelette and coffee.

I'll start with the cons:
- It is soooo expensive; my meal came out to be $17 with tip. 
- The service is not the best, although I did go right after they opened on a Monday morning.
- They assumed hashbrowns as my side even though I didn't even say I wanted a side.

However, everything is SO DELICIOUS!!!!! For real. My omelette was the omelette I've ever had- way better than Waffle House (sorry WH!) The texture was phenomenal and sooo creamy, and didn't taste overly egg-y. 

The portions are huge (other than the coffee). I wasn't able to finish my omelette and only had one bite of my hashbrowns before I was full. I will say though, that one bite of hashbrowns was great. Super crispy and the right amount of salt!

The coffee is also reaaalllyy good, I usually drink my coffee with cream but this one is great black. 

Additionally, you can get a free mint and Gambit. Definitely would recommend, unless you're on a budget or want phenomenal service (although I did not have to wait)."
839,SK02DwNQNiCpRy9ZODpA_g,Old school spot with super kind staff. Low prices and large portions. Nothing reinvents the wheel here but nothing wrong with classic diner fare
840,Pkhj8HmnK3d4mplf-a0vCQ,All of their food my family ordered was excellent.  Service was pretty good.  This restaurant is famous and it is a great New Orleans restaurant to at least experience once.  They don't take reservations and it is an odd way of seating people.  Everyone is in a line out the door usually and has to wait for a good bit.  That was to be expected with a popular restaurant.  The seating arrangement is not ideal for big group parties.  I feel like it is better if you just go with one other person.  I'd definitely go again to be able to try their chocolate cherry shake.  It was worth the wait!
841,hpXODbORV3dKI5W0EdIYzQ,"This is why I hate Yelp. People gave this place 4 stars so we went to check it out. Food was absolutely terrible - take Denny's, throw some cockroaches on the floor, add staff that is too busy on their phones and you have the Camellia Grill. Ok, to be fair, the food at Denny's is much better. Maybe Camellia Grill was good years ago but certainly a mess at the moment. Good luck."
842,TZvF0oYvvO_kooBDtbFQIw,"Amusing time here as someone with a birthday came in and the workers had everyone wish a happy birthday to her and it was followed by her singing ""when the saints come marching in."" Great voice. Food was ok, I got the Reuben and French fries. Fries were cold. Also noticed many of the workers were touching their cellphone and cash without washing hands so it kind of grossed me out. Not worth the long wait in my opinion."
843,rTC7BEScjk88MNAqPauXFg,"Quick meal meaning fast service 

This was my second visit. I went because my niece watches American Horror Stories. If you watch the show the last episode of the ""Freak Show"" or circus season is filmed at Camellia Grill. The sideshow acts walk in, have a seat and ask to be served. 

Sanitation is questionable but people still eat at Waffle House so what's the harm here. 

Very close to Audubon Park, Tulane, and Loyola University"
844,gkI365RX462XDguLK4Pqvw,"Big expectations but low performance. 

To start with the restaurant is always busy. The line extends outside of the restaurant as there is no waiting area inside. 

The service of this restaurant deserves a 0 Star. From the unfriendly lady at the welcome desk to the complete hodge podge in the kitchen."
845,OS5T6VDae_3aT6V7UiU9mg,"We stopped at The Camellia Grill after Mid Summer Mardi Gras to sober up a little. I've heard all about this place and definitely wanted to try out a New Orleans classic. 

There was a little bit of a wait for a seat. I didn't realize how small the restaurant is because it looks massive from the outside. 

I loved watching the waiters and cooks do their thing. It was really interesting to watch how they communicate the food orders. 

I got an omelet with hashbrowns and it was delicious and HUGE, which is perfect when you need some sobering carbs and protein. 

I'd definitely go back."
846,qFd7KpeqE4avZCOnDcKE3A,Stopped here today on our last day. What an awesome meal and dining experience. The atmosphere was great and the food was phenomenal !  Highly recommend this 72 year old establishment
847,FQ-gK0bAUysx1e8rrCT42g,"We came here for breakfast based on our Lyft drivers recommendation. WOW! It's a diner and only has a counter in it, so get there early! The employees were just hanging out with customers, eating their breakfast and working. It was such a cool place to go to. We ordered omelettes. My husband got the Chef's special. It has chili on top of it which we would not have thought of. It was great! He also got the chocolate pecan pie. We would definitely come back."
848,Vu_XnbcBxJhC08K1punyLw,"A recent visit to NOLA introduced me to the Camillia Grill. I arrived at 1:30 PM, got seated at the counter with no wait.

Marvin greeted me with a friendly smile and a fist bump...I was off and running.

The Hamburger Steak caught my attention, it arrived swimming in gravy, with fries and a side of DELICIOUS corn.

Marvin went to extra lengths, to serve my slice of Pecan Pie with a GENEROUS slab of ice cream. The slice was a close facsimile to what my grandma used to create. My neighboring guests were happy, food warriors. 

The Camillia Grill exceeded expectations. The food, service, people and ambiance were EXCELLENT...a SENSATIONAL dining experience."
849,mo5MZ0FNcBEB5kL7cY2eUQ,"Camillia Grill is a great place to eat
But the place is very hot during the summer time
Really hard to eat hot food when your sweating 
use the restroom had to walk through the kitchen 
I don't know how the workers do it working in the heat when it's much cooler outside
I know the place is clean but the building is so old it looks dirty The bathroom door so stain I use a paper towel to open it
But I am addicted to the food so I keep coming back"
850,cYWP1R1zjLS8xnh9r3W23Q,Best breakfast place ever open really late for those long nights after work or partying. Best way to recover from a hangover as well
851,7D3nrT7iRJzr7T05ytlDjQ,"Every time we visit New Orleans, we try a new place to eat. We thought the last place was our favorite until we tried this. This place was soooo good. If you like Waffle House, you'd love this. Staff is super laid back. I ordered a fried pork chop with scrambled eggs and loaded hash browns. My girlfriend had bacon, eggs, and grits (I think). We were both stuffed. Together we spent about $25. This is not your nice, upscale, breakfast diner. There is group seating, and we all sat around the counter, elbow to elbow with strangers. There's construction next door and the floors are a mess. But if you can get pass all of this, you won't regret it. The wait time was pretty moderate (20-30 min) and there's paid street parking."
852,SoT10thEOLNUYYnFwTDRmQ,"I have been coming to this place since college and try to make it back each time I am in town.  Most of the guys behind the counter have been there for over 15 years.  There is almost always a wait.  If it is a nice day it is not a big.

The service is prompt, but be ready to order if there is a big line as they like to turn the seats pretty quickly.  Don't look to thoroughly behind the counter; the restaurant is ""well seasoned"".

The ham and cheese omelette with fries are always awesome.  Occasionally, I will go crazy and get a cheese burger instead."
853,9tyY2sS9ipsAP7Rv_Qb5Uw,An absolute must on every trip to New Orleans. So touristy yet so New Orleans and so good. My favorite are the freezes/milk shakes with all the food.
854,lUUMIc8BpS0OzatNqEcOkA,"I wish I had read some of the reviews before I ordered my food. While sitting at the corner, one our worst pets crawled by me to say hi on the counter. I want to wslk out but I made sure to watch my food at every station. I informed the cook of the creature and he grabbed it with his bare hands. His co worker had to tell him to wash his hands.  I was just done. Could not sit in place to eat. Food was ok but not like the old days. Be careful if you decide to eat there. Think twice."
855,LRLldA-mKhD928NLXSiXtQ,"Horrible experience. Walked in, was told we would be seated, a server waived us to his section of the counter and as we proceeded, the Cashier/Receptionist snaps at us saying, ""Those aren't YOUR Sean s.""  Is he se very tried to intervene but she continued to be rude to is, so we walked out. 

Very bad first impression and service."
856,SBuWlSu7kNfAkEAm6uncSA,Best lunch counter dinner ever! Great Shrimp PoBoy and muffaletta. We had a chocolate freeze and if was flavorful. This felt very much like a place locals hang out and we loved the prices and food. Our waiter was friendly and quick.
857,VyJnltcs0kcBpDa8UEQKnw,Amazing food!! Best pecan pancakes I've ever had. Loved the corned beef omelette as well. Delicious and worth the wait!
858,vChGvFI76CShfF-cFmGINQ,"Hands down, best hole in the wall breakfast EVER! Been coming here for decades and never have been disappointed. Any omelette is the way to go! Skip the fries, grits are also so-so but with the portions you won't even have space for them. Also, the milkshakes are incredible. I loved the vanilla and chocolate but others swear by the orange freeze. Go early because there will be a line and it's a small space, but 100% worth any wait, every time. Have fun and interact with the cooks, they love to entertain and are awesome people."
859,y1D65i5D0h8Vw35MhP-s7A,When my gf and I visited New Orleans back in October  we ate at this place every morning for bfast. You gotta get there pretty early though if you want to eat bfast or you'll be waiting a bit but if you do have to wait it's so worth it! The staff is awesome and the food is absolutely delicious. Great food for a great price!
860,ubXECSIByY2s-aajM610Rg,"Just a small diner on Carrollton street? Not really...
This place is SMALL, but perfect. Run by locals and everything is cooked to perfection. This is diner food...Nothing fancy, but everything is done right. The staff are great and really enjoy making you happy. If you are looking for a great old time diner experience, you can't go wrong by coming here!"
861,SPLEs8z5cVi7VGosxhbOfA,"Love the friendly and helpful staff. The place is very small, but we were lucky to walk in and get a seat right away. I've heard the line is normally long to get in and I can see why. My burger was good and just what we needed before we started our bar hop in the city. Everything is coked right in front of you and ready so fast. I would definitely go back to this local diner."
862,mQCeiMaXBDK9Y8iqH5Hc7w,What an amazing ambiance.... it was filled with history and amazing people serving the food ! I had the sausage po boy which was incredibly delicious!
863,oKFS4qYwnEWUa3npHlxwhw,"Been in Nola for a while but just recently are here. The food was alright. Typical greasy spoon food, nothing to write home about. Bacon was burnt to a crisp but I happen to like that. While we were there a woman (champagne....the employees knew her but she wasn't wearing a uniform) came in. Apparently she had just gotten a pedicure and was carrying her tennis shoes which she then proceeded to put on the counter. When we asked about it her response was ""they must not know who I am"" and left the shoes on the counter. Our waiter was excellent as well."
864,pZTOrxv_NPhkkwZDxNsglQ,"Such a unique little diner. The service is awesome. Chicken and waffle was delicious. There are no tables, only a bar that fills the small diner. The staff are all attentive. We found this place by accident and love it. It's also Harry Connick Jr.'s favorite place so it has to be good!"
865,Bp8lWQhN99ZyJoOSn3Phzg,"Waited for twenty minutes and never got seated. People walked in and sat down, not leaving any space for my party of four. The confused lady working by the door doesn't seem to care about anyone else, just her phone. Great food, horrible service."
866,Pa7q46FdJnVlfREKX_6UIw,"soo everyone loves camellia grill.  i mean, if you dont like it, then...who are you? i say that in the nicest, most confused way possible.  seriously, i mean when you order potatoes for your omelette, they put freaking french fries in your omelette.  can it get better any better than that?

omg, you can't leave that place without ordering the chocolate pecan pie.  it's a pecan pie with chocolate chips that they lather with butter then grill 
THEN serve with ice cream...isn't that a dream? 

if you're trying to go on the weekend, just be warned, there's usually a wait on sat/sun...but i mean, just get a drink and wait in the street.   

p.s. i hope peanut still works there! he's this guy with a planters peanut tat who worked there before the storm and returned after.  say hi!!"
867,YdCEN8Ix1ELxHrtw5QzQPA,Have you ever wanted to watch a short order cook make a eight different omelettesall at the same time on the same grill? Well you can do it here!
868,3YdZx2bu943JzpcIqW_Asg,"I've been in love with the Camellia Grill for nearly 3 decades. Always fun, always delicious, always SPECIAL! You have never had an omelette this big or fluffy or delicious. The chef uses a malt mixer to make magic, fluffy omelettes, and the counter staff is fun, friendly, and helpful. Located in old Carrollton where the streetcars make a sharp turn, this is a NOLA institution and is not to be missed."
869,xhiPZNrRBEisrmIJA6VDgg,"The manager was horribly rude to a young man yelling at customers at for moving a table to get out of the direct sun. 

The poor staff has to listen to his angry bs, so we feel very sorry for anyone who has to put up with his junk."
870,3dGzSUSRq7EkvVoClDXdPQ,"I have not been here in the four years in NOLA which is very shocking. They do not have a waiting system except you stand in line when it gets busy which is annoying because then there's people that don't want to stand in line and they get mad because the lady told us that we all needed to stand in line. Anyways (went off there - really burst my bubble), the staff is friendly don't get me wrong but they forgot items on my order when its clearly marked and I just felt rushed. For the 30-40 min wait, I did not appreciate the 10 min breakfast time I had inside. They forgot my iced coffee and our order of pancakes."
871,Ybc9nHRrHGFgfMqlNwZH1A,Hands down best Catfish sandwich I have ever had in my life!!! Great vintage and friendly atmosphere as well.
872,y3CJ0PI7JqyduxLGmRc5uw,"This is my favorite spot to eat at ever. The people are amazing Ans the food is awesome. I am want to give this 5 stars because I have been going here for years and the people you interact with every time you're here truly deserve it. 

With that being said I want to give 1 star to the new owner from the interaction we had about two weeks ago. You see when we walked in everyone was happy and joyous as usual, the energy was great, and the food was amazing. Everyone was laughing and interacting with us until suddenly we watched all of our happy staff become quiet and timid. We asked our waiter what happened and he stated that the new owner was outside. The gentlemen was sitting with his family at a table outside with a G Wagon parked illegally in front of the restaurant. He made the entire restaurant shift it's mood and we soon learned why... he came in after about 15 minutes and yelled at the chefs in front of us and all the wait staff. We were the only ones in the restaurant but that is no excuse for the way he ripped into these boys. We listened to him yell at them for 5 minutes about things like how he wanted a little more chili on his fries as the boys just silently nodded. He continued on to say things we couldn't even understand as he got into the face of his staff. He then stormed back outside and sat with his family. The rest of the lunch was tarnished with the way this man spoke to his people that make this restaurant any happen FOR HIM. The boys were quiet and just kept their eyes on the grill. The atmosphere and the charm of this place was completely gone for us. Which is such a shame because I know the last owner and she would of never of done what this owner did. She would be ashamed to find it this way. 

Now, speaking as someone who has managed, opened, and run restaurants for years this is not how you run a business. I was so disappointed to learn that a place I hold so dear to my heart is being handled so poorly. And the people we love visiting being so mistreated. 

To the owner. I hope you see this and learn how to treat your people better. They obviously deserve it from all of your glowing reviews and I would hate to see an amazing place like this go down because you don't know human decency. Remember you are literally nothing without them and you can't treat people like garbage just because you're rich. 

Do better."
873,hrS-2c8I3AUmUWOU2Uc3Pg,"If you're looking for the diner experience, this is it.  There are no tables for seating, only barstools at the counter.  This place is a breakfast wonderland.  Eggs and omelettes galore.  My wife was quite pleased with her omelette.  I opted for the double hamburger.  It had that delicious grill-top flavor I remember as a kid from diners in my hometown.  I got the fried mac-n-cheese for a side.  As advertised, it tasted like fried chunks of mac-n-cheese.  Delicious.  They have a nice selection of pie, but we were too full to taste any.  

I strongly recommend you go in there.  It's got the exact right amount of greese you need to cure that hangover.  They give everyone a fist bump when the server comes up to you.  Pretty nice touch.  We'll definitely go back.

Cons:  My wife and I had a baby stroller which was tricky to manuver in there due to the tight spaces."
874,Ci1tmeZ03G0Z3wGPrSGpnA,"Great food,  great service. Exactly what hAt you need when you want a gooD hot breakfast without the chaos of a downtown restaurant."
875,gcxYk4hf07ezqdvWQOWe_w,"Used to be a must place but the service is abysmal, parts of orders left off, under or over cooked food, and an increasingly uncaring waitstaff. This place was amazing and have been going there for 45 years but after the last trips have all resulted in forgotten food on my order it's clear it's caliber of service and the interaction between customer/server is now over as well as the homeless chili.. two days in a row I had Brum and both days forgot my waffle. Last time is was Phillip  each time I've complained to the cute counter girl (Champagne) but she's on her phone so much and flirting with the boys that she isn't paying attention to customers  long story short, go somewhere that's not resting on its reputation (the Schwartz's are rolling in their graves over the way this place has gone down hill)"
876,KbwW4rdMdvAH-DAEMNhB2g,I keep trying to go at night but they're closed. It says open online but the door is locked and no one answers the door. Will not try again.
877,TZQdCOMoJI-Eg1fvMvop2A,Hubby and I are back at it !!!!!! Service and food was good .Quick bite to eat for lunch . Such a Beautiful Day . Burgers was just in time to get what they deserve!!!!  Nothing like good food .
878,8ehZdiIYjhtEEWHOgQ29Dw,"Ah, The  Old Camellia Grill. So many happy memories there. The chili cheese omelettes, the perfect cheeseburgers, the freezes, the Camellia Special and the pecan pie a la mode. Was back down in New Orleans for a reunion and had a blast; great music, great peeps, great food. Unfortunately we decided to hit up ""The Grill"" before departing for the airport. Sadly, this was not the place I so fondly recalled. We arrived after the tourist hordes and did not wait long but there was certainly nothing to wait for. Basically it has become a tourist trap; a dingy dump with long waits and indifferent service, a surly hood rat at the register contemptuous of the customers. The food; basically inedible. Straight off the Sysco truck crap. The Camellia Special used to be a thing of beauty; fresh house roasted turkey (i remember the turkey carcasses in the back) and ham on fresh rye with slaw and thousand island. Now, stale tasteless bread, vile grey processed turkey with the lowest grade ham meant for grilling (not eating) slathered with Sysco Truck garbage. The place ain't so cheap either. I now understand why the Tulane students no longer wait on line to eat here and can be found sitting at outside cafe tables enjoying breakfast on Maple Street. They know better!"
879,o2gdsZjh1cEfKubeC1w0gw,"Honestly this was the best food I had in New Orleans.  We tried Commanders Palace, Cafe Du Monde, a bunch of restaurants in the French Quarter and this place takes the cake (or pie).  I had the roast beef poboy and it was DELICIOUS.  So flavorful.  The gravy was great, meat was tender and packed with taste, bread perfect.  It's definitely messy but it is worth every second you spend in a self-imposed bib.  I also had the chocolate pecan pie with Blue Bell ice cream per the waiter's recommendation and let. me. tell. you.  I can die happy.  Generally pecan pie tends to be too cloyingly sweet for me but this was DIVINE.  It's perfect for those who aren't huge fans of chocolate because the chocolate isn't overpowering.  The slice is warmed on the griddle with a bit of butter and then served with the giant scoop of ice cream on top.  Please don't hesitate to go here."
880,_c3IEFqckYOz6ERIUgBusQ,"We've been coming to this place for the last 15yrs, off and on.
Always go for grits, wonderful as always.
Brum waited on us he was very attentive overly friendly. Asked question but don't think h listened or catered what r answer was.
We still return for grits and obviousness
If ur in NOLA it's a must"
881,7BIkhipfwk0Wc8daQdnX0w,"Nice authentic place. Got off from the street car and went there with our local friends who have been coming here since childhood. 

Food is good and the portion is large. We shared one dish with my wife and was fine. 

The interior look cool you can see the staff cooking in front of you. 

Nice place!"
882,KnvTNs466xxqlJXe5sRTYg,"Po-boy burger one of the best burgers in town. I'll start by saying, I hate fancy overly dressed burgers. Give me something simple that tastes great and no need to try and hide a bad burger with 10 toppings."
883,z2UweQ4hLNbLBmECkARXkA,"I love The Camellia Grill. The food is amazing! The only problem I've ever had is waiting for a seat and I don't like counter seats but I get over it every time.

My favorite thing to order is a bacon cheeseburger and fries! As weird as this sounds they have the best mayo!! I dream about these burgers!

I had my first Cherry freeze last night! So good. Now I have to get one every time!


I like the pancakes, the pecan waffle and all that. They somehow have liquid butter. I know it's not right but it's taste likes God's love! The sausage links make me so very happy. 

One of the best spots in the entire city!!"
884,9b5-UN7RXfDSf_D_u_IYbQ,"It's delicious diner food with great service. Everyone is quick, friendly, and welcoming. I've been there sober, drunk, and everything in between. Never had a bad time."
885,I7q0zRV5VXWbZG9T7o5VHw,"Food was delicious and the place is like a blast from the past. It's like you are dining in an old time diner. I really think ""Hells kitchen chef needs to go in there and remodel the whole place. It's clean but it's like old time clean."
886,vYUJXXYBQN2Ac_Vyl6GW5Q,Very disappointed. Waited 1 1/2 hours to be seated. Service not good at all. The cooks were interested in their cell phones and each other - not cooking our meal. Food was pretty good. Red beans and rice. Don't know why it took an hour to put it on a plate and bring it. People next to us upset too. Won't go back.
887,LDIQ5wLzzG-5jbj66aD0Gg,People here are very friendly and I see a lot of old customers. I got waffle with sausage link. It was quick and the waffle was awesome. Would recommend to anyone!!
888,gcd7EiwwrOypMHg8nRJZAQ,"Dive right in. For my money this is the best greasy spoon you'll ever find. 

A nice ride on the St. Charles streetcar, breakfast at the Camellia Grill and walking it off at the Audobon Zoo is part of my agenda for every trip to NOLA. 

I've heard that the burgers are great, but since I'm always here early in the day (you've got to catch those big cats before it gets too hot) I can't vouch for them. What I can confirm is that the CG whips up some of the finest omelettes you'll ever eat. After a short wait in line, that they worked through in orderly fashion, we were up with our spot at the counter. We were attended to promptly by our bustling server that was on top of his game. Egg white, spinach, mushroom, tomato and feta omelette for the lady. This East Coaster was drawn to the Manhattan omelette of corned beef hash, potato, onion and cheedar (hold the swiss). Both came with a generous helping of hash browns and we added some dry wheat toast. Although my wife griped about the omelettes being too well done, I knew it was all thanks to the ample seasoning of their busy grill. I watched them scoop many slices of bacon off the sizzling grill in front of us and just smiled knowing where all of the flavor came from. The pecan waffle that the dude next to me had looked delicious too. I'll have to keep that one in mind for future visits, though I'll surely omit the ""liquid butter"" that I saw all the other diners smothering their waffles and pancakes with. 

Just about the finest start to the day aside from morning glory."
889,177pL6onhCNymOOX79LADQ,"The staff here were so friendly and the food was soooo good! I made sure to leave room for the chocolate pecan pie with a scoop of ice cream... even if I ate my entire meal. The waiter gave us good recommendations on the menu and was all around super friendly. Also, with the only seating in the restaurant being at the bar top/counter, it was easy to start a conversation with the other people eating there. You need to come and visit this place. You'll be happy you did."
890,y6qYH3UUsv8s3_5SU3qKhA,Not a single hairnet or mask was worn by employees to include the chefs. That was a turn off
891,G1vHFHbKzWM7ikKr-pOf3w,The history is a part of their customer service. The food is delectable and the outside seating is heavenly.
892,n5SsSAf7BkrfC-noOT2A_g,Rude staff and not COVID safe. The seats are not socially distanced except for two benches on the sidewalk. I was turned away for asking to sit at the bench because my party wasn't large enough even though it was the only socially distanced table available. Food not worth it based on my past experiences.
893,cOVOKLRMoDgkUfY_znfiQA,Skip the food and just go for the desserts.  The Chocolate pecan pie was buttered and grilled with the biggest scoop of ice cream you've ever seen.  So good it was sinful!  The ice cream freezes were the best things my kids had ever tasted.  Loved it!!
894,YSpsKSzi_eagh14SHJc5_A,"Order a Doc Brinker's Special (double meat cheeseburger with melted American & Swiss cheese, grilled onions on toasted Rye with Cole Slaw and Chili) and a chocolate-cherry freeze (or orange) and make your soul feel GOOD. Finish with some grilled chocolate pecan pie ala mode and put yourself in a food coma."
895,wcany2NnQLVd1i9NBYze6Q,"Coming from Austin I always try to do the old standards when in New Orleans. While Austin is losing our weirdness, the Camellia Grill has lost their sense ability. Frequent prior visits to this iconic eatery were pleasant and satisfying.  Red beans and rice pretty standard certainly not disappointing, omelets are okay but nothing to write home about. Cheesy fries are just that.  Wait staff was more than pleasant, standard banter politely funny, this is after all a counter only establishment. 
My disappointment was ordering a grilled chicken breast dinner plate. Maybe I was expecting too much from a counter only grill when I ordered a dinner. When my dinner plate arrived I thought the chicken was under the fries and only the edge was visable. BUT NO that skimpy 1/4 inch thick shaved piece of chicken was it; did I forget to mention an inch and a half by two full inches...yeah a full mouth full, more than a single polite bite.
Okay so only a sliver of a runaway starving chicken should have been a clue. That poor chicken must have had a very rough life cause it was not just tiny but tough. Under sized, over cooked, the grill gets a zero for their attempt to satisfy me.
When I asked the waiter if the rest of the chicken had maybe fallen on the floor he suggested I tell the manager! When I complained to the manager he looked at me incredulously. Full jaw dropping disbelief
as if I'd just criticized an epicurean standard. 
I know this ain't Commander's Palace, but I expected more than the old Woolworth counter at 6th and Congress in Austin. If they can't do better, this item needs to be removed from the menu."
896,DIDbiYNVIJqf5Z7f0nSFtw,"Decided to pick up breakfast last Sunday. I  ordered the Mexican omelette, the Rano omelette, grits and hash browns. The food was pretty good the service was interesting. Seemed unorganized and the cashier wasn't so friendly. Probably won't go back. Trolley Stop is a better choice."
897,KOP5pyWEskLJ3Xv2gW3Gug,"At the far end of St. Charles St., past the Garden District, past Tulane, is this great little diner where the locals go for breakfast or gumbo.  

This is true Southern diner food.  Pecan waffles.  Cheeseburgers covered with strips of bacon.  Omelets smothered in chili.  Awesome gumbo, only served certain days of the week.  Counter seating as well as tables.  Lines of locals and Tulane students waiting outside for late breakfast, just like the popular brunch spots in Lincoln Park and the Gold Coast.    

It's about a 20 minute streetcar ride from the French Quarter, a wonderful ride through great parts of New Orleans, past the Tulane campus entrance and Audubon Park, just where the St. Charles Streetcar turns right at the end of St. Charles.  During Mardi Gras they stay open until 3am."
898,Aaa8esL_6ogZs4JPc2-48w,"Seating us at a lunch counter. Vibe is solid old school diner. Right on the St Charles streetcar so easy to get to.

Service was fast and food was tasty."
899,IME4C2idlquerVtjJg1RLw,Mmmm this fantastic little place is the definition of a greasy spoon and I loved every minute of eating here. We came here late night and surprisingly didn't have to wait at all to be seated. The entire place is counter dining which provides lots of amusement and great quick service. The food was absolutely phenomenal. I ordered the bacon egg and cheese sandwich which was perfect and the chili cheese fries were heaven. I also tried a bit of someone's cheese burger which made me regret not ordering that and also had some chocolate milkshake. Wow wow wow... really awesome diner food. I am definitely going back!
900,C8AeezbMXR6PurNORU9uRA,Fabulous bacon cheeseburger and chocolate freeze (milk shake). Fries weren't bad either. Classic diner and a fun place to go!
901,ni1pWEqsv7xkLox2cA55uQ,"I wont say its the best burger place in the city but i will say its my favorite! If this little dinner is legendary in New Orleans and for me it is one of the few places that lives up to the hype, I dont know why dinners drive inns and dive's hasnt already checked this place out already, but all im saying is Guy's Mustang would look really good sitting outside.

This place is unique and its a gem, I love the old school flavor of the place, it makes me feel like im in a episode of happy days, you walk through the doors and you are transported to the 1950s except without all the segregation and racism, to me the best way to describe it is like a waffle house if you actually hired decent cooks who are not drunk and high on duty and excellent service.

This place has been around forever and its not going anywhere, its the type of place were you will take your grandkids and tell them stories about how you use to come there when you were their age.

I keep it simple, I get the one eyed Jack Burger with Bacon, medium rare, the one eyed jack is a cheese burger with a fried egg.

But its not really about the burger or the food, everything is good and all but for me its really about the people, I can honestly say that you can tell that all of them were hand picked for their unique and big personalites, which makes the place uniquely New Orleans.

Oh and dont leave without a Milkshake!"
902,pr2eE9ZiXAfeMocmEtYuzw,This place is one of my fav's but cleanliness has to get better. I am a big fan of Bar Rescue and Hunger Investors so I try to look at places through there eyes. I think the food is great though the One Eye Buck is to die for.. And I also love the chocolate freeze!
903,t3ZxbpycISu4eKnaKYebIw,"Highly entertaining dining experience. Whether they mean to or not, the cook and the waiter usually put on a show while cooking and serving food. So, sit at the counter and enjoy the show.

I always think they are going to get my order wrong. How can someone possibly remember 6 orders that were just screamed to him? Yet, each and every time, they get my order right!! I was pretty convinced that I was going to be given a chocolate freeze, but nope, cherry (just like my order) was given. Down to the ""no mayonnaise,"" they always pull through. And what they pull through with never disappoints: a damn good cheeseburger & an amazing freeze. 

When you're done being entertained and gastronomically fulfilled, take your order ticket to the cashier and be on your way until next time."
904,zbHrbH1m_MIUTxWuGGwIOg,"OMFGGGGG!!!!!!!! Where do I begin???? Ok let me start out with the ONLY negative thing I have to say. When we walked in there was a faint odor of mildew... ok now that we have that squared away, let's talk about the service! I am in New Orleans often so I'm very used to the southern hospitality, but our waiter (Terrance) was 5-star! He was so pleasant and super attentive! THE FOOD omg the fooood! I was not happy about my moms choice of eats this afternoon because I figured diner food  blah blah blah... I WAS WRONG! Omg was I wrong! I ordered the waffle because when in doubt at a diner GO FOR THE WAFFLE! It's safe! Man was I RIGHT! That was theeeee best waffle I had in my life. No exaggeration, idk if it was the melted butter you get to pour out of a diner syrup pouring thingy lol or if it was the thin crispy texture. It was heaven! I ate the waffle and had to order another! Oh but let's not forget the chocolate pecan pie. Omg listen, the short of it all is, IF YOU ARE DEBATING IF YOU SHOULD GO, I'm telling you to GOOOOO! Order the waffle and chocolate pecan pie! Oh yeah my mom had the JouJou omelette and she said it was delicious. My son had the chicken tenders and fries and he enjoyed it! I wanted to acknowledge the female waitress (I didn't get her name) but she was very nice and even helped my son out. Great visit!!!!"
905,_-2T-FXl-IpOYrHP_h3I_g,"My friend wanted to come here for her birthday breakfast. When we arrived there was a long line, I don't know if it was because it was New Year's Day or if it was the normal breakfast crowd. Either way, the wait was worth it. Once inside I understood why the line was long. Basically you're seated at a counter that stretches from one side of the restaurant to the other. 

The food is prepared in front of you and served hot and fresh. The food was amazing. I ordered the Joujous omelette and crispy waffle with bacon. I don't know what kind of maple syrup they use but it was amazing. Also they have liquid gold (butter) that tastes great. No complaints on the food or service. All around great experience. Would definitely come again."
906,J0-vWw2LHGA6lR7EIVNgkg,Dennis is great! Our family loved him and he was super polite. :-) food is also 10/10 would recommend
907,xDSYzZsPGNCQcTTiVNz8HA,"It saddens me that I have lived in New Orleans for over a year, but have never been to this place until this afternoon.  

After a long night of partying in the French Quarter, I needed breakfast food-fast.  I had walked/ridden by Camellia Grill several times, but had never ventured inside.  I decided to go, and I sure am glad I did.  

I ordered the Chef's Special omelet, which consisted of cheese, bacon, onions, and potatoes, served with a side of fries.  The whole thing was topped with chili.  It.  Was.  Amazing.  The omelet was fluffy, since they beat their eggs using a milkshake machine.  Everything was cooked exactly right.  The server was very friendly, in fact, EVERYONE was very friendly.  My only regret was that I ate so much that I saved no room for their freezes or their pecan pie.  But there is always next time!"
908,exCkkN2qAhgoE5Tu8Bxpbw,"We really wanted to love this restaurant, But they really screwed up. We waited for our order for more than 45 minutes. My dish (omelet) came out cold and all 3 plates came out at different times. Food was okay, service was BAD! Server didn't even care & simply said ""I won't charge u for the omelet""."
909,ZAgS9s9CuGTEtKbNRPhwRA,"So this place was recommended by our Airbnb host and by Yelp!, so of course I had to make my group try it. Our Airbnb was only 15 minutes from it by street car so it was perfect. First off I loved the counter idea. If alone, it kinda allows you to meet and speak to the person to the right or left of you. Also, the counter allowed for a great view of the chefs cooking your food. Our waiter was a tall thin white guy that was amazing and very friendly. Why was he amazing you ask...because there were 7 ladies in our party all with varying orders and substitutions to our order and he remembered everything without writing it down and was able to repeat it back to the AMAZING chef without ever having to write anything down. I've gone to restaurants where there's only 2 other customers and the damn order taker can't get the soup correct. 

So the food...well first lets just start with the grits. If you love grits...you would love THEIR GRITS...omg amazing! Then the pecan waffles. Definitely NOT Belgian waffles, more a thin waffle with plenty of pecans...still amazing. Their omelets were huge, well stuffed and very tasty. 

I appreciated that despite the size of our party and the fact that the restaurant was filling up as we ordered, we still received our meals in a very timely manner. THEY ARE FAST. The only disappointment was that they did not have many ""traditional"" New Orleans specific type menu items. 

This place is definitely a must visit for the friendly, fast and fantastic New Orleans culinary experience."
910,JPL3paT1M3U-r6dmF-9mEQ,"Didn't expect it but, The Camellia Grill was definitely cool. The prices are very moderate as well. Pretty much every menu item that we have purchased was really fresh and delicious. I became very good friends with the staff, who are all wonderful and super welcoming. The Camellia Grill, I love it so much."

912,k0w7oBPL9zBz417Yew2log,"This place normally has a line out the door but it moves fairly quickly. The small restaurant/diner is all bar stool seating with no separation between parties. The meal and wait comes with fun entertainment from the staff. All the workers appear to enjoy what they do. While we ate breakfast they sang Happy Birthday to a few little girls. They counted the age of the girls as a cook beat on the grill and the male workers would turn each other around like ballerinas with the number of spins corresponding to the bday age. It was kind of comedic and I know the kids loved it. 

On to the food...we had the mushroom with gravy omelet and a bacon omelet. Both came with fries and the eggs were cooked to perfection. I asked for my gravy sauce on the side because I was unsure of it, but I ended up pouring it all on there because it was soo good. We had 2 different milkshakes which were both great. They fill your cups to the brim and use real icecream. 

For great food and a fun experience, where you get to see your breakfast made before you, come here. 

P.S. We did not try their burgers but many people ordered it and it looked good. We have heard good things about it as well."
913,03bb4xOaUDOogHiXSvCDbg,"I went on a Sunday wearing a Saints t-shirt. I was greeted by Marvin w/ a ""who dat!"" The Chef's omelette is so amazing! It has everything you'd ever want in a breakfast, esp if you had a few drinks the night before. I ordered and when Marvin asked ""Chili good?"" I said (as everyone should) ""Chili REAL good!""  Great prices, tons of food, friendly employees, and great conversations w/ your neighbor at the counter!"
914,RwJkWTSDvlUFGk39G1d9sw,Huge omelettes in a scenic and picturesque area of town. Old school diner vibes so don't expect the place to look fancy but the breakfast is worth it!
915,LOLeP245Kv1-gv0lFhT92Q,"Atmosphere - lively, fun, and talkative
Service - loud, bantering 

Food - pretty awesome
Hamburger - solid and cooked perfectly
Red bean and rice - smoky, meaty and tender
Chocolate Freeze - well done

Everything you want and expect from a hamburger dinner experience"
916,mzekFOwMpIq2VfYTVnFHHA,"Cute spot right when you hop off the street car! The restaurant has one long tabletop counter seating, which creates a great intimate feel. Chefs cook your meal right in front of you, so you know your breakfast will be fresh, hot, and tasty. The staff of waiters are extremely friendly and charismatic. I ordered the Rano's egg and spinach omelette and my boyfriend ordered a bacon and egg omelette. Everything was delicious! I give it four stars because unfortunately, you have to walk through the kitchen in the back to go to the bathroom. A little out of the way, but it's how they manage with the space they have. I'd recommend if you're visiting NOLA!"
917,i1RMp-weMwN2QgKDW5j7ig,"Saw this grill on somebody feed Phil. We loved the food and the service from the waiter. The lady at the cash register was horrible , not friendly at all , seemed liked she did not want to be there. When I called ahead of time I asked how busy they were, she just said we are very busy, when we arrived they were not .Poor customer service from her only!"
918,JqitniFJGp_0_N3mdRtVoA,"Love the friendly and helpful staff. The place is very small, but we were lucky to walk in and get a seat right away. I've heard the line is normally long to get in and I can see why. My burger was good and just what we needed before we started our bar hop in the city. Everything is cooked right in front of you and ready so fast. I would definitely go back to this local diner."
919,71yxZQGTlz_2e6XfdgUA0Q,"One of my wife's regular hangouts in college.   I just fell in love with Camellia Grill.  I totally loved their pancakes and I just have to say, a pitcher of melted butter is a freaking brilliant idea.  I also tasted my wife's corned beef omelet and it is going to be a regular breakfast for me.   All counter seating so the wait can be brutal.   Worth it though."
920,9brM5AWRwYNnHGqXmDw4WA,"We had a recommendation from a local to try this spot out...we went for the Judy ""JuJu"" omelet with American cheese and hash-browns. We sat at the bar in front of the grill and it was fun to watch them cook all the food. Our order came out timely and looking delicious! We dug in to find a generous portion of shrimp, spinach, onion, and cheese. The flavors melt together to form a perfect bite! Really enjoyed it. The servers were funny and nice...we had a great time talking to them. They also were very attentive and kept our drinks full! Overall a great meal. Would gladly be back!!"
921,GXRlYbMjBIhaJvQ-GRq2EQ,"Tasty food in a throwback diner style atmosphere. 
I enjoyed my visit. The catfish and eggs was REALLY GOOD. We loved our waffles too. 
Not too fond of the liquid butter but that doesn't stop us from loving this place!"
922,SqqUeFCViwXDQSrPzhSO7w,This place is amazing. I usually get the burger and fries and I've had the sausage burger and it was delicious. The people are always so sweet and quick to get your order and food out. I definitely recommend this place if you are short on time and still want to sit down and get some good food!
923,-xyLwBHmElva2qv1rEF2hQ,The best old style diner food anywhere!! We had a group of 8 and didn't have any problems being seated. Wonderful food and service. You can't make a bad choice when ordering. Breakfast anytime. Take a street car down St. Charles Ave from Canal street or take a walk because it's worth it.
924,1slBSr24EZn119DjU_EV5A,"Omelettes.  They are feather-light and packed with tasty goodies. I had the cheese omelet with hash browns.   We were there Christmas Eve.  It was packed and we had a party of 5.  Fortunately, the hostess is very clever and very efficient and we were seated without a long wait.  Service is fast and efficient.

So, get your friends, sit down at the stools, and feast."
925,pELQgg9Y2RsWj8D0sW5B8w,"What a great place!  I found this place via Yelp. I walked in and the place was packed. It was a true diner experience. It was very tight quarters (side by side), but since I got my shots - I'm good to go. For a great show / breakfast - I say go get your shots and then come sit next to me for a great breakfast and friendly discussion. 
I had the Manhattan Omelette with jalapeños. It was very tasty and will order it again. The young lady sitting next to me had the special with a chili top. It looked great. This food was very solid.

I love HoT food. This place is so tight - there is no time for the food to get cold - it is awesome. Ok now for my final OMG. You gotta order a side of packages. Again - it hits the counter hot and ready to enjoy, but then the waiter drops off two little containers diners. One is liquid butter and the other is big daddy sugar cane syrup.  Wow - it was awesome. 

I shall return with my family - next time we are in NoLA."
926,71lCkEgQWf-evwZmEsaiIQ,"Wanting to venture out away from the unpleasant sights of downtown New Orleans for dinner, a cousin of mine recommended the Camellia Grill for dinner. So the family and I decided to take a little drive and check this place out. 

Upon walking in, you are greeted by a cashier that tells you to take a seat where you like. The setup is that of a diner with fixed barstools and you belly up to the counter. The family and I took our seats and were handed menus and a water. 

After making our decisions, the wife had red beans and rice; my youngest had a chocolate chip pancake; my oldest had chicken strips; and I had a bacon cheeseburger with fries. A lot of the stuff on the menu looked delicious. Since we were jerks, and came here 30 minutes before closing, I picked a cheeseburger quickly without thinking. 

In good time our food started arriving piecemeal. The four of us started enjoying our meals promptly, so these folks could go home. 

The cheeseburger was delicious. Very juicy, yummy bacon, gooey cheese, with the perfect bread to meat ratio. The fries were your basic fries, but great. The wife enjoyed her beans and rice, for the most part. She noted that there were clumps of uncooked rice. The kids enjoyed their food with no complaints. The service was also awesome and our waiter (who was also a cook!) did a great job with a friendly face and kept our drinks filled. 

I highly recommend this place. I did think this place was a little pricey, but it seems like everything is around New Orleans. 

I want to try and come back before I leave New Orleans. Give this little jewel a try if you are in this area! 

Enjoy!"
927,KXDO727lxjgZXoqYRgEhPA,It's a diner! The wait staff was friendly and helpful! The Greek omelette + grilled shrimp was very good!
928,nrvLk0kG1XA5XRPZeIbgdA,Friendly staff and decent food. Very messy/dirty. Although you get to watch your food being made in front of you the dirty environment makes the food quality questionable..wouldn't particularly recommend but worth it if it's your only option in the area
929,9t-RSrwDzRajteJADHhj-w,"Almost everything I've had here has been the best of that thing I've ever had.  The best omelettes, the best burgers, best sandwiches, best pie.  This is seriously where I'd have my last meal ever, a chili-cheese omelette with fries, a chocolate freeze, and some pie on the grill with ice cream."
930,UdZuNijbC5ALiD44wI7o2g,"Ok. How I missed this place is beyond me. I am HANGRY writing about it. 

Wanted a simple burger and fries. This place does not disappoint!!! It is a smaller diner style joint, and you walk in and sit wherever there is space. The servers are extremely friendly and fun to talk to about the menu. 

My server was Cam. Totes. Adorbs. He recommended the pecan pie for dessert. OMIGASH. AMAZEBALLS. Not too rich, and the scoop of ice cream hit the spot!!!

Cheeseburger had something I consider crack in it; I wanted to eat four of them! Fries - delicious. I'm so hungry . 

They are open till midnight but I heard when they open at 8 or whatever in the morning, the line is around the block of people waiting to get in. I don't do lines, so I will continue going at random times. 

Check this place out!!!!!"
931,n6TJbtgzhKMfPFikkJaAWQ,The menu is very simple but the atmosphere is very unique. There is only counter space that faces the kitchen kinda like the old vintage cafes in movies. Food is not for the health conscious but so good.
932,FiWX5RUkiDBvQFS5_JtQ3Q,"Well, we had a group of 7, so we split up the group.   One of the children ordered milk, and there was some kind of crud in the glass. GROSS!!!!   

She refused to eat her dinner after that.  

The other issue we had is we ordered a Swiss cheese and bacon sandwich, but received an American cheese instead. So she would t eat it. I swapped my meal with her.  

Lastly, our third granddaughter got up from her seat to talk to her dad (she is 7), and the server immediately dumped her plates.  I said something immediately, but it was too late.  The server said he would get her another meal if she wanted, but was too late for all of us to wait around for another meal. 

I so wanted to live this place, but I can not recommend it."
933,Hgvq72DnCtqnSYIllwqChw,"I don't even know where to begin. For this restaurant being a staple place to visit in New Orleans, I'm completely disappointed. Not only did I receive the worst service of my life but, I was also treated completely different from others. When you walk in you sit very close to others in a bar type seating. Which is totally fine but, you are up close and personal with others. With that being said, I'm able to see the difference in experience I was receiving compared to others. Im a local. Im born and raised in New Orleans. I'm not trying to make this into a racial thing but, even my boyfriend noticed how different we were treated. I was the only non-white person there. My waiter came to us as if we were the worst type of people. No excitement, no mono toned, came across angry, and was clearly not happy to be at work. We did not come at a late time. Possibly around 7:30pm or 8pm. Our waiter took our order and put it in. Turn back around to take someone else's order from the left of us and he spoke to them as if he was King Tut. Literally, he put our order in, turn around and was a brand new man!  He had great energy, joking around, and even laughing! I'm wondering to myself....what did I do to this man to treat me like this? I came in to enjoy a New Orleans experience and I felt as if I was look down on because I wasn't white with a Rolex on? What? Waiter assumed he wasn't going to get tipped well? That's why he didn't even bother to give me great service? First thing first, this is a burger joint. I'm not expecting for 5 star restaurant service but, I mean I get more pep from someone working at Applebee's. Which by the way if you order anything else beside their hamburgers or, milkshake, you messed up. My boyfriend order their omelet it was dry, dry, DRY. I order the burger and shake. Kept it safe. I would rate my burger and shake a 3 out of five but, the service was horrid. Shame too because their milkshakes are bomb! Too bad I wasn't treated fairly too. I would never ever come back or, entertain anything that is Camellia's grill related."
934,5_lN08VJxajyL5dSYhREYQ,"Sometimes I ask myself if I keep coming back to New Orleans just for the chocolate pecan pie from Camellia Grill.  There is a lot to love about the city and this is at the top of the list.  It is definitely that good, perhaps the best ever.  And, it's shocking each time I watch them put it on the grill and drench it in butter but man I was missing it before even getting back home.  They used to have a storefront in the French Quarter making it convenient to bring a whole pie home, my friends and family loved me more for that treat but after a long feud between owners now that store is closed and the original is a long cab ride away.  Unless you can time it with your departure the logistics don't work that well.  It's unfortunate because the runner up versions don't even really compare.  The diner is countertop service with waiters who have been there a long, long while.  They make it fun for you.  I hear the food is good as well but I just go for the chocolate pecan pie."
935,CA-67m55MQaypSzRpeaawg,"This place is the best!  I used to go there all the time when I lived in NOLA, and now I need to go there every time I get back. It's delicious!  There is a line nowadays, but it's okay. It's worth it. I always get a cheese and bacon omelette. I also get a chocolate and cherry freeze. I adore the staff.  They are really hard workers and they do a great job. It's definitely a place to eat, enjoy, and leave so others can enjoy the delicious food and great staff. I think all people should understand this. Anyway...I just love this place, and I don't think I'm the only one who feels this way. Enjoy!"
936,GWaY18nxg010TxczN1wZUw,"If you want to stand in line for 45 minutes to be rushed through your meal. This is a great spot. 
If you want to hassled and harassed  by staff while you try to order your breakfast.  This place is great.  
This place is not worth the time.  Lots of options around the neighborhood.  
Beware of the hype. Its lame with lame pretentious staff."
937,PRutaR5ZHlAL0IlbJvUyZw,"What can i say, i absolutely loved the feel and atmosphere of this place right when I walked in. The workers there were very friendly and they were quick to attend us and to order our meals. 

The menu had a different variety kinds of food such as breakfast foods, burgers, and sandwiches. 

I ordered the cheeseburger and chili cheese fries. Delicious burger and chili cheese fries were steaming hot. LOVE. I want to come back to try their breakfast foods such as their omelets and also their shakes!"
938,v8nEEGfP3WK8ERYbbmVqyg,"Nice to drop in again after 30 years...
Take the St. Charles street car uptown from Canal Street to the bend in the tracks at Carrollton and you'll see the Camellia Grill on your left.
The atmosphere is 1940s, had the 1940's been integrated and fun.
Uniformed men serve as waiters for the counter-only service.  They are friendly and efficient.  Twice in an hour, they banged the spatula on the flat top to get everyone's attention so that the entire restaurant good sing Happy Birthday to two customers.
The food was very good and inexpensive.  The pancakes were thin (as pancakes should be) and were served with a choice of cane or maple syrup.  I'd never tasted cane syrup before so that was interesting.  A side of grits cost .99.  
It's all a bowl of good."

My favorite foods: omelettes (veggie omelette with turkey), roast beef poboy, and chocolate pecan pie. I like to ask them to pour tomato basil on my omelette. (I'm probably the only person that does that)

The experience at Camellia Grill is unlike any other. It's no wonder tourists stop by here so often. Although the type of food isn't exclusively New Orleans food, the people are definitely New Orleans. It has the culture and personality that is pure New Orleans.

The bathroom is in the back in the kitchen. It's kind of confusing and awkward at first. But it adds to the uniqueness of the restaurant. It's a very ballsy move showing your back kitchen to any and every customer. But I respect the hell out of it. It's one of the cleanest industrial kitchens I've ever seen!"
940,yUvgUyZJ3G4vR1NGvp981Q,I'm not sure what happened to my pictures but my food and experience was excellent! Braun was very attentive and also made great recommendations. I like that there is a full menu all day. We were in town for the weekend and I've been wanting to try this place. Amazing!! I will be sure to to every time I visit .
941,UvLJb6r0FBFGm3yhO_PDTw,"The sandwiches here are pretty good, but I would lean more toward the 7/10 than 8/10 (since this is out of 5 stars). My favorite sandwich is a reuben, and they do it justice. Although, I would ask for light dressing if you do not want your sandwich to go soggy because they can be heavy-handed with the thousand island. I am usually not a fan of mayo, but I find that the thousand island balances the components of the sandwich well. Expect around a 12 dollar bill for the sandwich, but you will likely get a side with that price. It's about on par with Couchon, but with a side and not quite as good a sandwich. 

I would recommend going if you are in the mood for a sandwich and are willing to pay well for it. If you fit the description, I would even recommend going a bit out of your way for this place, here or Couchon Butcher (in the CBD/ Arts area, my preference)."
942,Mth-lolVGVx9wqWWWk99lQ,"Heard about this place for years and finally went - what a disappointment!  Dirty, dirty, dirty - gave me the willies looking around. Food was OK, nothing to get excited about. Although my wife had a hamburger and it was very good."
943,zDW4GrTwadXsTKUJ3TpKXQ,"Camellia Grill, such an amazing place to dine.
I had the standard 2 egg breakfast with sausage and fries
Now, I am a bit of a stickler when it comes to my eggs.
I love my Eggs Basted Lightly, still runny, but not snotty, if you get my drift.
Camellia always does them right.
If you can do that, you can make any style of eggs to perfection.
I love the crowd, the service and the atmosphere.
If you are expecting class, do not go here.
But, if you want a diner, the way a diner is supposed to be, this is your place.

945,uIcz5a3KdhxSbmSzY-QmTA,"-just as good as we remembered from previous visit. Originally opened in 1946 and closed for a long period following Hurricane Katrina, new owners subsequently reopened. Just a good old-fashioned diner with nothing but southern hospitality all around. Perfect for our last dinner in NOLA. Snug space with only counter seating. Hostess pointed us towards the open spots and we tucked right in. Gleaming white and chrome interior with smiling, bow-tied servers behind the counter. Menu is surprisingly large for a small establishment and includes breakfast, po-boys, burgers, plus southern specialties such as gumbo and catfish.  And their famous chocolate pecan pie. All prepared right in front of you while you enjoy the atmosphere around you. Everyone there during our visit seemed to be happy and having a great time, including the staff.  Today we picked a Hickmen's burger for her and a cup of gumbo and a fried catfish sandwich for me. Our super friendly server delivered my gumbo and gave me a hint I wish I had known sooner. He tells me he always gets his catfish covered in gumbo! Sounds awesome. Next time! The gumbo here was maybe my favorite of our entire run through the south. Deep flavor but not too spicy. Plenty of chicken and some nice peppery sausage pieces. Should have had more.

My wife's Hickmen's burger comes with Swiss cheese and sautéed mushrooms & onions. It was served cooked perfectly medium as requested. She doesn't usually have much accoutrements on her burger but she pronounced this one ""really good'. Fries were fresh and hot. My catfish sandwich was fantastic. Two freshly fried filets on a toasted bun with lettuce and tomato. Added a little tartar sauce for a bit of flavor. If you like this type of sandwich, don't hesitate. The whole meal was just so tasty. On our previous visit, it had been recommended to us to not miss the chocolate pecan pie. We didn't and it was delicious. They also serve traditional pecan and apple pies here.  When our server first approached us, the first question was ""Are you out of chocolate pecan pie?"". They were not. When I let him know we were ready for pie, he asked if we wanted it griddled. What? That's a new one on us. He said they just set it on the griddle (same one meats are cooked on) to warm it, flip it, and add vanilla ice cream. We chose to skip this but saw it done for another customer and it did look mouthwatering with the chocolate and ice cream a little melty. Personally not sure about the whole griddle/grease thing. The pie was just as we remembered and it was devoured quickly. If dining at a NOLA institution and looking for local dishes served with friendly customer service is on your list, make your way here. It's right on the St. Charles streetcar line in the beautiful Garden District which features some of the most exquisite architecture in town."
946,1nKGlzokrEsNAfpqAZN6ig,Very different then any other place I have been it brings you back in time to food was very good stuff
947,uY8Zgc8fK70MbmTS7bHYIg,"I've been craving breakfast from here for awhile. It looks like the perfect little weekend joint. There's limited seating outside, and just a diner style bar inside, so you have to hit it at the right time if you don't want to wait. 

Luckily, we hit it perfectly and were able to score a great outdoor seat. The service was slow, even though we didn't really have any competition for service, but it did seem like every table had a different server. 

Ordered some chocolate chip pancakes and a waffle, thinking it'd be quick and easy. That didn't happen to be the case because of them having to stop and clean the grill, but when we got it, both were delicious. We were then already forgotten by our server and weren't able to get any refills or service once everything was dropped off, but the rest of it was top notch!"

I came here to refuel the day after the marathon last year and it was just what I needed. HUGE omelettes, tasty food and friendly enough staff (I'm from South Florida, so the bar on ""friendly"" is pretty low!)

I do get the feeling it is a touristy type of place, but not in a ""trapp-y"" way. The wait is long and you do have to be OK with sitting right on top of the person next to you."
949,nfOcmHEm2oic6rxQcS8nRw,such a fun diner experience! food was delicious and hit the spot. loved the simplicity of the breakfast po boy.
950,Ptrk1Z5sARB6pvT6022soA,"This is the exact restaurant that I look for in any place I visit: an authentic, old school, and incredibly delicious diner! My friend and I visited during Voodoo Fest and we stayed in Carrollton, and decided to walk down to Camellia for breakfast one morning. The food was incredible, everything you want out of southern style comfort food: crispy bacon, creamy grits, and perfectly cooked hash browns. We ended our meal of grits and various other starches and fats with the most delicious piece of pie I have ever tasted! Along with the food being amazing, the staff was just as awesome. Friendly and funny, the conversation was delightful without being intrusive or ""too"" attentive; you want to keep talking and keep the conversation alive! I definitely recommend Camellia to anyone looking for a filling and delicious southern breakfast!"
951,I50rFE1XxgNK4DxsMwhAuA,"This is probably one of the greatest places to eat in all of New Orleans. The atmosphere  is upbeat and it is a timeless place to go eat. The food varies and is served liberally. I would definitely recommend a mocha freeze as they are essential to life in New Orleans. 

Make sure that when you go there, you talk to the cooks and servers, they are interesting and engaging and can tell you a lot about life in New Orleans."
952,9qAiEu1aaAypl_m_6lsNmA,"Very greasy and overpriced for what it is.  I guess if I'd had a hangover I might have appreciated it more.  I don't think foodtv's diners dives and drive thru's will be coming here.  We didn't get the singing servers - they were kind of out of it actually.  Had to keep asking for a coffee refill.  Won't be a place I return too.  Also, asked for side of grits and instead of charging for side of grits they charged for side of fries (which came w/the meal) While that overcharge only amounted to a buck, it didn't seem right.  With tip it was $25 for a greasy breakfast on a hard stool and poor service. (oh and stomach ache to follow)  Your call!"
953,O88Z2jc-0KRzf_v6xanGfQ,"Maybe I ordered the wrong thing( shrimp pob


Maybe I ordered the wrong thing( shrimp po-boy- only 4-5 shrimp per 1/2. Very tasty but more bread than meat"
954,lTBWYfM4i7U78YhvuTpzWQ,"I haven't been to Camellia Grill since 2009 and in 2021 the food is just a great as I remember.  The pancakes, grits, bacon and eggs are my go to.  The grits are amazingly fluffy and tasty without adding much else.  With the pancakes they give you that melted butter love and high grade a maple syrup.  If you are having trouble sleeping go here from some breakfast/brunch and you'll get the immediate itis.  The space inside is small but worth the wait or you can eat outside at some of the seating they have.  The food taste amazing and the service is just as good.  They make you feel welcome.  If you're in NOLA do yourself a favor and stop on by."
955,iXDHaqMSAYtv-VUkmwmZPA,Awesome crew!!! Just real people.  Great place to take visitors or out of towners. i had an overstuffed chicken salad sandwich. took half home. see pictures
956,k8CyGdNTF3nDqXrq2CSY4g,"We heard about the Camellia grill from a local of some report, so after checkin' the numbers, it was yelp approved, so we parked across the street and went inside. I'll say, I was disappointed after. They are fast, and they make a clean, no-frills burger; I added syrup to my bacon and egg burger, making it a proper breakfast burger. But after trying the fries - which are too fried to be good by the way - and the bland burger, I'd never have a reason to go back.

It turns out this place is down the street from the University, so I'd suspect that adolescent sphere of influence has something to do with it maintaining as a reputable diner of 4 stars for so long. From what I gleaned, it's just a sub-par burger made of very cheap ingredients. Nothing flavorful, just edible. It is novel the way the orders are delivered, yelling them out across the room to the line cooks assembling through memory alone. But with the possibilities of NOLA, to waste a meal on such pedestrian fare is near sacrilege. I recovered the night at the Creole Creamery - try that instead. For quick food, try Cajun Seafood or Cochon; honestly, I'd say local chain restaurants have more things worth your dime than Camellia Grill: cheaper, and faster. 

Taking locals advice sometimes works out, other times not so much."
957,1vTsKdIWfnyG1MIjNxATPQ,"Camellia Grill is an all time favorite of mine. I used to come here almost weekly when I attended Loyola for undergrad from 2011-2015. I'm pleased to see that the quality is the same! 

The atmosphere is simply unmatched. You are welcomed with warm smiles and ""how you doing baby"" from the moment you enter. Mr. Michael has been my server for years and it brings me joy to see him still warming people's hearts. The way they convey the orders to the chefs is still mind blowing to me!

Of course, the food is BOMB! I've tried almost everything on the menu over the years, with my favorite still being the bacon cheeseburger. It's just SO good! 

10/10 forever!"
958,2Y01ap7njZBlZ5ymf-VAlw,One of my  favorite places to grab a quick  bite in New Orleans. Loud and busy like  a  old time diner. Delicious burgers!
959,lBwnwoBVQPfxpNezxtHMGA,"The Camellia grill makes you feel like you're part of the Camellia family. You got your momma who greets you at the door on your way in and out with a familiarity as if to say, ""you can't say hi?""... You have your poppa who always know what to say to make your bellows produce a big hearty laugh from the depths of your soul. You got your uncle who's a saint with sauté and a boss with the burgers. And you have your brothers, one who's specialty in the kitchen is pancakes and he makes sure everybody knows it, and another who's mastered the art of chili and omelettes, and the other who's a blending machine, and can whip up the thickest and richest milkshake you've ever tasted. That's how I felt when I visited Camellia grill for the first time, and how I felt every time since then!   So how bout you come join the family too, and try out Camellia grill! They have a taste for every taste, and they make the food right in front of you, which adds to the intimacy. You're bound to join a conversation, or start one, with your newfound family members behind the counter, as well as your long lost family members tightly squeezed on bar stools right next to you. You'll definitely say, ""pardon me,"" or ""I'm sorry,"" as your elbows touch various patrons who also are elbow deep, enjoying a great meal. You'll hear and say multiple thank you's throughout your meal and on your way out as your fists bump your uncles, poppa, and brothers behind the counter."
960,7pNwAPyAiesqbVAcoN_vpQ,"Looooved this place. Great service, food, and clean environment. The Western Omelette was perfect and each ingredient was cut perfectly. The grits were creamy and flavorful and I their gumbo is the best I've had so far."
961,bT-ZFecbwgx57De8TZcIhQ,"Good Gracious!! After seeing the line for our original choice, we found this place recommended on Reddit. Make it a point to stop here. Jody, our server is one the best I've had ever. The food is excellent and with service to match...

Make it happen!!!"
962,HHmd5xSTcp0AUbKxt1Ajvw,Hadn't been here in years. Was glad to see it survived COVID. All was as remembered. No wait so that was a treat. This spot is definitely an experience if you visit the city.
963,9n7meiyT5SjU5H0u99pXFA,"Love it! Great atmosphere. Food is delicious. And the service was fun. Our waiter was Melvin and he was a funny, charming, and fun to watch. Best burger in the city. Seeing a grill close range makes it feel more personal. Never seen a joint like this in all my travel.

Their coffee is bold and strong, love it.

964,ecuxA_h_G5uagV053Vpn8A,"It's kinda crowded and you often wait in line for breakfast. I wish they had real cheese, not just ""american"". The long bar isn't ideal for social distancing. So why do we come here for breakfast every single day? Must be something about the food! In a town full of wonderful breakfast options, this is our very favorite."
965,IQ9CcMFFTaIS7EGEfDI6sg,"This is a great place to grab a quick bite any time of day, but especially late at night. Counter seating only, but thats not a problem because the service is extremely quick and professional. Food was great too. Nothing too upscale or anything, but still good."
966,v7dHQ1HKGbbberNkLfayBw,"I don't think I've ever had more fun eating at one restaurant. The vibe alone here gives it at least four stars.

A friend and I came here on a recent road trip through New Orleans kind of by happenstance. A lot of the other restaurants were closed and coincidentally this place was closing in an hour or so but they gladly took us in.

The Cameillia Grill is famous both in the area and fans of AHS: Coven as scenes of the FX series were shot here.

It's a small diner with a few chairs going around essentially the grill/kitchen. A group of guys me and the entire diner from cooking cleaning serving and hosting. Each one of them had a smile and brought an absolute level of customer service and care to their customers and they made us laugh.

Now for all intents and purposes, this is a diner. A no-frills, not fancy establishment. You're going to get hotdogs, hamburgers, french fries, and maybe a Po boy.

Since the meals are made to order they happen to get made quickly on the large grills they have. I ordered the sandwich that basically was two hamburger patties on a hoagie roll and it came with a side of fries. Not the healthiest thing I know, but hey it's vacation. We laughed as I eat my meal because we heard the guys working there talking and giggling. The guy said he never seen anyone finish that meal. Little did he know how quickly I would finish it because it was so good, and actually I could've maybe had part of another one.

Like I said this is standard diner fare. But it was so good. The guys who work here make it even more special and it makes you want to come back for more.

Oh! And get the pie, they are known for it! And their chocolate freezes. It's like a wendy's frosty but better. Definitely worth the try."
967,CId4tYZUoE8bDos0-J09Hg,Not what it once was. Waiters are surly. Guy sitting at the register watches everyone like a hawk. Overpriced
968,u00eoftZp0CWOp9ExFBAUw,"It's a cute, old-school diner. 5 stars for the vibes but 3 stars for the food, so overall 4 stars. It's a fun experience but the food is what you would expect - nothing spectacular, and a little overpriced for what it is ($12 for an omelette)."
969,bP6_WEBmpTAWKmD1JCkeog,I love this place.  It was a first breakfast spot for me years ago during my very first visit to NOLA in 2008.  Took my sister during her visit recently.  The staff is also so charming.  It's inexpensive and you get a ton of food!  I try something different each time I go and I have never been disappointed!  My daughter loves their onion and potato omelet.  This last visit I was talked into the chili cheese omelet by a regular.  It was huge!  So good.  They also have great coffee!
970,nlOsPnE3T9bawDby6opDJg,"So this was my second time eating here while visiting NOLA. 

Pros: 
Great, friendly service
Orders come out quickly 

Cons:
Bar seating only. Not very comfy stools 
No parking; must park in lot  across the street 

The red beans and rice was excellent. But upon return, I had the gumbo  My rice was also a little crispy 

The burgers are to die for!!!"
971,fha6hcioMpeqsqxFbAC50Q,"After a late night in the quarter and some sluggish traffic on the way back to Metaire I decided to sleep in...until a whopping 6:00am.  With 6pm reservations at Alinea for The Tour and uncertain lunch plans I wanted something filling that wouldn't take too long but would also provide one last memorable experience of New Orleans...I thought waffles and pie fit the bill nicely.

Walking into the small restaurant I found both the facade and the countertop layout to be particularly ""homey"" and pleasant.  With four servers behind the bar and three open stools at the dead center of the action I waltzed up and sat down only to have the two chairs next to me filled seconds later by another couple and a subsequent line begin to grow - it was 15-20 deep by the time I left at 9:15.

Greeted promptly by my server, a short African American fellow wearing a badge that read ""Sleepy"" I chuckled at his low voice, smooth demeanor, and tired looking eyes.  While the name may have fit his look, it most certainly didn't fit his efficiency as he moved quickly around the bar serving multiple persons in multiple seats without missing a beat.  A menu placed in front of me and water and coffee filled I was told to ""gimme a holler when you're ready"" and Sleepy went off to serve other diners.

Browsing the menu didn't take long but watching the expert grill man was definitely a distraction worth watching as he worked griddle, grill, and waffle irons rapidly.  Sipping my coffee I have to say it wasn't the best of the trip, but for the price it most certainly wasn't bad with it's heavy chicory notes balanced by a bold chocolate and woody undertone.  Catching Sleepy with a nod of the head he came over to gather my order, checked off the boxes, and passed it on to the cook.

Sitting back and watching the show that is the waiters at Camellia I have to say I was amused - it is rare to see people look like they're having so much fun working together, especially with such efficiency...it reminded me of Dottie's in San Francisco or The Griddle in Los Angeles, but more culturally oriented and humorous....though perhaps more choreographed.  Watching the look on his wife's face as my neighbor received a gigantic omelet with chili and a chocolate shake for breakfast was another great treat while I waited a short 15 minutes for my first dish to arrive.

Brought hot off the waffle iron (irons that look to have been through a war in addition to the hurricane) and placed before me with a ""there ya go - and here's the cane syrup, ignore that maple stuff"" my pecan waffle looked quite unlike the fluffy buttermilk waffles I was familiar with but moreso like a 50/50 mix of dough and pecans - crisp, golden, and flat.  Topping the waffle with the liquid butter (recommended by another server over the hard butter) and the cane syrup and proceeding to take a bite I was surpised by the texture - fluffy and nutty to mastication and actually quite delicious on its own, but even better with the syrup and butter.  Not overly filling on its own despite its large plate size I was quite happy with the waffle - though it had no chance to trump what followed.

After taking a seat and ordering more waffle I'd asked if the Pecan Pie was available so early in the morning to which sleepy said ""it's never too early for pie"" and while eating my waffle I watched sleepy cut a sizable slice from the refridgerated pan and hand it to the grill man who subsequently placed it top down on the hot buttered grill and allowed it to cook for approximately 5-6 minutes until the buttery pecan and cinnamon smell was evident even at my seat.  Flipping it off the grill onto a plate and passing it off to Sleepy he noted ""HOT PIE COMING THROUGH"" loud enough for all to hear.  Presenting the plate to me he said ""Hot Pie - but it looks naked...what this needs is some Ice Cream!""  Chuckling and nodding my head in affirmation Sleepy pulled out an icecream scoop and placed an enormous scoop of vanilla right on top of the pie exclaiming ""WHOOMP - There it is!""  Melting rapidly atop the scorching pie the icecream quickly cooled the dish and taking a bite I was quite impressed by both the smoothness of potent vanilla ice cream and the buttery cinnamon essences of the pecan pie.  Eating slower as the pie began to cool I was more impressed by the lack of ""filler"" and the plethora of pecans as well as the buttery crisp crust...from now on I think pie at breakfast will be a vacation requirement.

Thanking Sleepy and his cohorts for a great experience I picked up my bill and made my way to the door where you pay a friendly lady who chalks up the tab based on the checkmarks.  Given the option to tip on my credit card or pay the server cash I simply put another 20% on the card and made my way to the street with a big smile on my face - and a smile on the face of the people waiting in line for a seat - a sweet ending to a great trip."
972,AxsVNCJU4F4rBdhBwAQ2og,"Old school grill. Lunch counter style seating with flat tops where you can sit and watch the chef prepare your meal. The hamburger was fresh and the gumbo was great,"
973,KqouSCH2EtCiAf1a_ISwJg,"If y'all are wondering where the bacon is, it is right here. Best BLT in town, and get the fries. You won't regret it."
974,eOQyg2tOV4Zct2NjAd_WRw,"The diner atmosphere is very neat here! I liked the way they kept it old school and traditional. I got here right in time after church. Last minute decision so I didn't have time to view yelp and see what's good - oh well! The moment we sat, the wait became 30+ minutes. No reservations but I'd say between 10-11 on a Sunday you'll have that opening for a seat quickly. The breakfast rush has died down and the lunch rush hasn't begun. I think I may have ordered just a wrong item because I wasn't impressed with the Turkey club. I was upset. The service was busy so it did take some time but the atmosphere made up for it. Others who were with me ordered the chili breakfast omelette and all raved about it. The chili tasted wonderful and word is that's one of the popular dishes. Definitely will go back after reading reviews on what else to try. They also are on food delivery apps!"
975,N14ZM6AmtPRHDSb_p2oL-Q,A must try if in New Orleans ... it's where all the locals go to eat ... best pecan waffles and chocolate freeze ever ... naturally N'Awlins !
976,RpY-OEUZKCbex-POEzHecg,"Major disappointment.. Host and staff rude, order took way too long and was forgotten, Pecan waffles were mediocre, and the 4 strips of bacon were shreds.. Lol.. I guess a TV show can make a Dump look Good, Nothing special, But a tourist trap, Dint waste your money!!"
977,ROuBb5jAl-1w8KHu9xIKuw,"This was definitely a cute little diner. It gives your that ""at home New Orleans"" vibe and it was a nice change of environment from the places I ate out here. 

Service: 4/5 rating. Very sweet men that work that. They definitely made me feel welcome. 

Food: 3/5 rating. Omelettes were huge. I was pleased with mine but I tried my other friend's dishes and they were not as good as I anticipated. I asked for extra crispy hash, but the serve did not relay that info to the cook. 

Seating: 2/5 rating. Definitely small. No tables for yourself. You sit with everyone. So if you're not the type of at diner places like these and possibly sitting next to strangers, don't come here. 

Overall, it was a good place. I would definitely go back and try out their other specials."
978,sqKwXyu_1UD-zlWBkPvOGQ,"It very good small dinner, but what you really get is a piece of history. The wait staff are just great, and such interesting people.  This place has been the same cool spot for decades."
979,yodSgYo34TfGvEhOfOWs6g,"A friend recommended this place for us and to be honest I was thinking I was headed to a fancy breakfast but upon entering soon realized I was walking into an iconic, friendly, cozy atmosphere with amazing food. I couldn't decide what to get and was looking around at everyone else's plates when our server made a suggestion...The Chef's Special Omelette!!! I ordered it exactly the way it is on the menu with zero changes. After the first bite, I was hooked. Needless to say I couldn't finish it all but I left with a huge smile on my face, an extremely satisfied belly, and with a fist bump to our server. I will definitely be back on my next trip to NOLA and recommend you go try it out yourselves if you find yourself looking for a breakfast spot when visiting."
980,fmy2foeL_meIONPe0d3MdA,"There are few perfect places. This might be one of them. The Camellia Grill is as reliable and practical, rusty and pristine as one of the old tools passed down in your family for generations. They don't make them like they used to."
981,AVxmsoxixGCipzzFiIH71A,"Comfort greasy spoon at its finest. A seat at the counter is definitely the best seat in the house. The servers were attentive and friendly (my coffee cup was never empty).  I had fried chicken and waffles. After a night on the town, this was the perfect breakfast to get me back out and into the action. A bit off the beaten path but well worth the trip."
982,sGGXGrnBucf7RI75cZeBpQ,We got lucky and there wasnt a line to get in.  But if there was would be well worth it.
983,9emsZarysKPB_BGvUHxwBA,"Still a classic breakfast place! I was happy to see they had eggwhite omelets (Rano's omelette w/spinwch, onions, and cheese/hold cheese if you are dieting), since I'm being careful with what I eat. (Ignore the fact it's cooked in butter and amazing). We sat by the omelette ""station"" this time and I loved watching th guy ladle out huge spoonfuls of beaten eggs, and then open all the drawers below the griddle to pull out toppings and throw them in the omelette (hence the omelette ""station"" term earlier, the drawer of toppings was so awesome and I wish I had it in my house). My husband loved his chili cheese omelette and got chocolate pecan pie because he's crazy, and I cheated and snuck a bite and it was incredible. They'll even serve it with ice cream if you want!

It usually packed and a bit chaotic as some rude locals try to push past and grab a spot before all the people waiting in line, so I was happy to see they had a girl by the door today who made sure people were seated in order, and that the locals couldn't push past (which led to two entitled couples huffing off after they argued and tried to negotiate their way to the front). So thank you!"
984,oYrC10oY1Dxd5oHmMoh2WQ,"The grill was manned by Brandon, who was welcoming when I arrived and even came outside to check on me.  I talked about how he got the omelet so darn fluffy.  Yummy food!  Great service!"
985,gtiCM2mFlJ4Q3XzcjfV6Mw,"Best gumbo I've ever had, my only complaint is that the portion was a little small. As far as the other food that I ordered, portions were large and the food was great."
986,bBdgQ5N_89KevCm5qp3cdA,"Ok let's start with the good and and with the bad. 

This is my second time coming here and the food and service is always awesome! Came in with my sister and niece as this seems to be a tradition when we come to NOLA, waited for about 45mins to eat which is the usual so I don't mind because of the good food. After we were seated, ordered and food came about 15 mins after. DELICIOUS! 

Now! For the bad part..... I'm very concerned about the hygiene part of the restaurant. As we were waiting on our food I had to go to the restroom now I know this has nothing to do with the service but it was kinda bothersome knowing that I'm about to eat in a place where the bathroom is so disgusting! And when I say disgusting I mean it! Toilet paper all over the floor and someone decided that they would wipe their bloody fingers where you would reach to get your tissue from. I didn't want to touch anything in there, it felt like I was in the matrix trying to use the restroom..... Sigh! It was too much! 

Now back in the restaurant as we waited to be seated there was food all over the floor from where previous customers had eaten.... No clean up krew? Camellia  please! Please get it together because I love your food. But I don't want to come back if I'm concerned for my health by the lack of cleanliness from your restaurant. I say this all with Love 

Adrianne"
987,-gXVPyVkuCP-erzFdDeBDw,"Camellia Grill is a bit off the beaten track if you are staying in the French Quarter or the business district but it is worth the 20 minute trolley ride ... and maybe even worth the 20 minute wait for a seat.  Fortunately, we didn't have to wait!

Food: Typical diner fare for the most part, although the omelettes  are out of this world.  Seriously, best omelette I've ever tasted.  Soft and fluffy, not sure what their secret is but I likey.  The girl friend got the mexican omelette, which was stuffed with ground beef and cheese and decorated with a heaping serving of picante sauce and bell peppers.  Spicy!  I've heard the omelette to get at Camellia is the aforementioned mexican and their house special.  The fries that came with it were kind of bland but mostly just ordinary, so I suggest asking to substitute those with grits.   

I was pretty disappointed with the pecan waffle ... don't get me wrong -- huge chunks of pecan in the batter, probably more pecan than waffle actually -- but therein lies the problem.  It's not fluffy at all!  It looked squashed (almost like a waffle panini) but somehow was able to swallow a heaping serving of maple syrup and beg for more, so maybe its diminutive size is all an optical illusion anyway.  Still, I guess I'm a visual eater and definitely a texture eater ... I want my waffle big and fluffy ...

It's worth noting that I do believe EVERYONE there was either eating a burger, or ordering one.  To the dismay of my girl friend (who was really craving a burger), I didn't order one.  Every burger-eater in the joint had a big smile on their face though, and no scraps on their plate when they were done.

We got two friezes (milkshakes), the chocolate and coffee frieze.  Liked both, although I'd go back to try the vanilla double-scoop frieze, especially if I am staying at a hotel with a functioning gym ... only complaint about my coffee frieze was it was very slushy.  Maybe ask to cut down on the ice and double the ice cream (I think they use Blue Bell).

To finish the decadence, we got dessert.  You cannot go to Camellia and NOT order dessert.  Seriously, if you want to make a checklist of what to get when you go, stick with the omelette, maybe a frieze, but definitely a slice of pie.  We shared the vaunted Grilled Pecan Pie (served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream) and Coconut Creme Pie.  I never had coconut creme pie before and shit, it was good.  So good I stole the last bite from my girl friend.  And it was a big bite.

Atmosphere: It's definitely not a date spot.  In fact, there are no tables, so plan on getting to know your neighbors about as well as you know the dining companion you arrived with.  You sit at a stool at a bar that wraps snakelike around the diner.  You order and viola!  Your food arrives soon after, although I never felt rushed (just don't turn around to look at the hungry faces of the people waiting for your seat).  Extra points for being able to watch them cook up all that greasy goodness right in front of you.  Transparency is always a good sign, wherever you eat.

Service: I had heard that Camellia got its reputation for having the rudest waiters in all of Nola.  I guess it's just the opposite now, because a reason to make the trek over to Camellia ain't just for those delectable omelettes -- it's to experience the singing, dancing, always-entertaining troubadours that, oh yeah, also cook and serve you food.  I imagine it can get old quick, but I don't think of Camellia as a place I'd go to every week anyway.  Still, great for kids, great for breakfast (or late nights) and a fun place to sit down and kick your shoes off (provided you can get a seat!).

Value: A little expensive for a diner, especially for the food that you can get better elsewhere.  But like I said, stick with the signatures: an omelette and a slice of pie and you are set.  I'd go back and try that greasy mound of beef on a buttered bun that is the Camellia Burger (I think it's copyrighted) but something tells me I can get a better one for much cheaper at a Nawlins fast food joint down the street."
988,FaqKEol0Lye3uJiXtHdXhg,"I love the casual vibe of this place, and the food is quite tasty. I ordered the tomato basil soup with grilled cheese, and it filled me up! My only concern is due to CoVID. The seating is pretty cramped in there. But no worries...I'm sure you can order takeout if you're worried."
989,PsWZU2dyIpWJZYxfgpqZMg,"The Camellia Grill is an institution, so much so that they were filming a segment for a TV show/movie on my recent visit (and the fascination surrounding this outweighed the delay in service that happened as a result).

Here is what you will find...

1. Servers like Michael who take a lot of pride in their work. They call out multiple orders at a time, then the cooks go to work.
2. 100% low counter seating. Every seat faces the kitchen. If your larger group wants to have a conversation, this may not be the best place.
3. Delicious breakfast options (standard eggs and bacon, grits, omelettes, pancakes), burgers, shakes, etc. Imagine taking the best of Waffle House and Johnny Rockets and putting it into a fun, local establishment.
4. It is crowded at peak breakfast and lunch times.

Take the St. Charles streetcar out from downtown earlier in the morning for a great ride. Camellia Grill is located right after the car turns right on Carrollton at the end of St. Charles."
990,Cdvkgbw0LhwJ931y0P4xbw,"A New Orleans staple. You absolutely must come to Camellia Grill. The servers are wonderful and the environment is charming. The wait can be long, so I'd recommend coming at a random time that's not breakfast or right after an event lets out at night. My favorite things on the menu are the chocolate freeze, pecan waffle, chicken salad sandwich, shrimp poboy (not as much shrimp as some places, but really fresh and perfect bread), onion rings, the pies, and the omelettes. You really can't go wrong here, so order whatever you want. It's all good."
991,LK-FBiZH1O2KPpPCaKwLPQ,"If you enjoy close quarters and greasy food, this is the place. My mother used to love it. I could not deal with it after high school, decades ago. I seem to remember they had something with chili. Breakfast food was delicious; just could not tolerate the setup."
992,d9krfGOn2Tl-jfOD4LtDSQ,"Can't say enough about this place. We have been to New Orleans a couple times and we will never miss going to this place at least twice when we are in town! This visit we had The Hickmen's burger- Swiss, grilled onions, and mushrooms. The burger is of great quality and cooked just right. Also, the gumbo is some of the best you will find in New Orleans. 
For desert we got the chocolate pecan pie with ice cream. Can't go wrong when you watch you warm the pie up on the griddle with butter!!

All In all, well worth the trolley ride out there!"
993,NhUXls5hSHNufFoFPqW7zQ,"First off, if you're a picky ""oh I MUST have my eggs lightly scrambled and the crusts cut off my toast, which should be the shade of a Brazilian  beach boy's bottom."" type of diner...then go somewhere else. Please. 

And if you're health conscious, well, there ain't any room at the counter for you either...the door is that way.

OooohEwwwww...it's old and dirty? See ya. ::points to door::

Okay, now that we've rid ourselves of all the hyper picky, super hipster types...let's get down to eatin some eggs, cheese, pie and LOTS OF BUTTER!!! And let's get loud, but still say please and thank you, and cheer because the Camellia Grill is back in business!!!

This is diner food at it's best (and worst, if you're worried about your arteries). It's an open grill. It's down home. It's satisfying. It's so bad for you, but it's so gooooooood. There is simply NOTHING healthy, but you're not going to care. From the moment you sit at the counter and look up into your waiter's eyes, you know you're going to be fed like you were in your great auntie's kitchen. You know, the one who cooks with lard and has no clue of the concept of  ""just a little slice"" .

Did I mention butter? Oh yea. Buckets of butter are employed. On everything. I think I've actually slid in and out of the door before Katrina came and cleaned the floors a little. But I'm happy to report that as of this morning's waffle and grits fest...the floor felt a little slick again. :)

Since the grill *thankfully* reopened almost a year and a half after Katrina, there's been a huge line to get in any time after 9 am. So if you want breakfast, get there by 8. You can always go back to bed and sleep off that omelet and side of fries. (the one that's made with about 7 eggs, half a pound of ham, a quarter pound of cheese and at least two ladles of melted butter dispersed throughout the cooking process). This morning, I skipped eggs and went for the pecan waffles. Twas a very good choice. :) I wanted a grilled cheese too, but I wasn't going to push my body's capacity to process dairy. 

You can replace the fries with grits. And the grits are consistently excellent. Just the right balance between too sticky and too watery. Mmmmmm....

But I'm just goin' on about breakfast. As mentioned previously, the Reuben is a good choice, and I'm a fan of the Pattie but the best thing that has ever come of the Grill's grill is the pie. The signature pecan pie, tossed on the grill and covered with...you guessed it kids...BUTTER!...is a caloric death wish, a gastronomic game of Russian roulette that simply should not be missed. If I'm feeling like I need a healthier choice, I'll opt for the apple pie, which again, is tossed on the grill, buttered and then garnished with a slice of cheese. 

Dee-freakin'-lish!

So again, my DC friends, I share with you something dear to my heart. Visit New Orleans, stop at the Camellia Grill, take a seat, do the snakebite with ""Word"" if he's working, and don't forget...""please"", ""Thank you"", and ""May I have some butter with this?"""
994,c_teSw9XJk__4bTPG3PNiw,"Camillia Grill is back 
opening hours are 10:00Am to 7:00PM 
things are better  place is clean and comfortable finally got the AC working in the dining room outside seating"
995,m733xTS8Q1kqr0tMxI6GZg,"I don't know how this place was never visited by me before our summer visit. My kids and I love breakfast food anytime of the day and our hotel because of COVID had a closed meal service so we wanted to sleep in but didn't want to miss breakfast so we did a quick Maps search for nearby breakfast options and checked Yelp reviews and headed out. Oh it was definitely a great choice. It's a small diner type set up like so nostalgic but we chosen to eat outside because seating was limited inside and there was a wait, once you visit you'll understand why a wait and won't mind that you waited. Geesh I thought we had photos of this amazingly nostalgic place with amazing breakfast but sadly I don't but trust me you won't be disappointed. 

I love love grits and I had traditional breakfast items grits, scrambled eggs, toast, bacon. Looking forward to my next breakfast here."
996,z4_kXXZOesRC1U6EdI0d1w,"I'm out of order ... not as in chronology or as in kaput, but in the order in which I had planned to visit the Camellia Grill.  Furthermore, I had planned to visit their newer location in the French Quarter.

Well, I drove into town and, coming in on I-10, the Louisiana Welcome Center lady told me exactly what ramps to use for City Park, so I visited that first. Then, do I take Esplanade or Carrollton into the center?  Carrollton looked wide and was an easy choice. After a 3 hour drive to get to town, I was hungry.  And I knew Camellia Grill was at the ""elbow"" of Carrollton and St. Charles Ave., so I kept driving.

Just like all the pictures you see, the Camellia Grill is in an oversized white Greek revival style house.   You don't even need the address.  You can't miss it.

Getting right to the Camellia Grill's food, it was very good.  And, damn, did it over land on the table (I mean counter) quickly.  At first, it looked weird.  The omelet looked just like the hash browns.  You know, omelets are supposed to be yellow and hash browns are supposed to be a golden brown.  A bite into the omelet did away with this fastidiousness.  I had ordered the Manhattan omelet and had them add mushrooms to it.  It was one of the better omelets I've had, especially for being in a borderline dive.  And, I think I had a cup of coffee, but it could have been an iced tea.  I think it was coffee.

There are some funky things to note.  First, there is no individual table or booth seating.  It is a long counter that makes several bends and at which everyone is seated next to each other.  It's fun because you can see what everyone else is eating and can try to figure out where people are from.  Second, you pay at a cash register upon leaving, where a tourist weary cashier takes your money.  Third, the servers are crusty characters.  However, they have to ham it up to live up to to the Camellia's reputation.  It feels more like dealing with a carney barker than a waiter.  So be it.  Fourth, if you are willing to walk a few blocks and read the parking signs, parking could very well be free.  Lastly, the St. Charles streetcar passes right in front of the Camellia Grill, so even making it an excursion from the center is easily done and it's a nice ride.

So, while my trip to the Camellia Grill was ""out of order,"" the meal and the experience were very much made to order."
997,I1uQeSSOD6g2QqF7gcyG9Q,"A hot day in Nola and we wanted something quick and stumbled upon this restaurant. We walked in and noticed it was all counter seating with seats close together. Personally it's not my type of restaurant but the service was really good and the food was decent. I would of give. It 3.5 stars but that isn't an option so 4 it is. We tried the pecan waffle (please note this is not a Belgium waffle it is a very thin waffle, even smaller than a pancake). Taste was decent. We also had the chicken fingers and they were a nice size. Had a hamburger which was cooked properly. We tried the vanilla and coffee freeze and they were ok a lithe on the bland side. All and all a simple restaurant with home cooked, comfort food."
998,bsr6hO4mx5KGVDXCuBU1zQ,The host was a complete jerk. Actually heard him call a waiter a crack baby. The food was good but not what I expected from hearing locals talk. Possibly due to the recent storm but they should be used to it. Our waiter was amazing! Him (Brandon) I give 5 stars. He was running around but doing it with purpose and doing a great job considering the situation.
999,WUHC0P7BS1QCa5S2P1ngCg,Excellent Service and food!  You must try the Chocolate pecan pie!  Dennis was a great waiter and really took care of our large group!
1000,trv1JoiFKLLQGqJawY2Ozg,"On top of seeing Camellia Grill on Somebody feed Phil, we were recommended to stop in by a few locals. It's an old style diner with counter seating, fast service, and southern hospitality. 

For our meal, we started with some delicious iced coffee. Following up with pecan waffles with chicken and an order of pancakes with sausage. This was by far, the best waffle I have ever had! Finally, for dessert, homemade Banana cream pie. Words cannot express how incredible the pie was. I would probably get 2 slices next time... There is no doubt that we will be back next time we are in NOLA. Highly recommended!"
1001,UQ5XVSZpX1phWDX5eaWP4Q,"Yum - I love this place!  I stopped in with a coworker and we enjoyed the gumbo, red beans and rice and some chocolate cream pie...delicious!  The counter seats are great, so you can interact with the staff - who definitely show their southern hospitality.  This place is super good and very reasonably priced!"
1002,VT4NmRuuhVA6rsg461l-eg,Service was fast and great enjoy the meal it's a must do again It has an old fashion ice cream Ice cream Paula look different vibe
1003,M7rDU-r-q0mzYpSEXYImZg,"I will admit that most of my large party of 10 colleagues were hesitant to stay when we initially walked in and saw the setup. Our original dining location was a no-go when we couldn't find parking, so we ventured down the street to Camellia. All diners are seated at a counter, with no individual tables. We had a great experience and we're happy we stayed. Our waiter, Dennis did an incredible job taking care of our party of 10. He was friendly, courteous and patient as we made our selections. He was also very knowledgeable of the menu. Camellia is truly a diner- with burgers, breakfast, a few home style meals and more. My unlikely combination- a small bowl of gumbo and an order of pecan pancakes worked out great. The gumbo had a thick roux and was filled with lots of chicken, sausage and okra. While it still can't compare to my moms, it was a tasty version. The pecan pancakes were delicious! Buttery, with vanilla and sweetened just right, it was also packed with lots pecans. I didn't have the burgers, but others in our party thought very highly of them. We were too full to try the pecan pie, but it looked great. Great stop and I hope to try it again on a future visit to NOLA."
1004,T4cH5byh9PdKwD3OYHIWaw,A lot of memories made here over the years. Step back in time and wait in line it's worth the experience. Good omelets especially late at night.
1005,_voXlZlLprjLySe1gmHZuw,"We came in here as a recommendation from locals--and it didn't disappoint. After a long day of walking, we really just wanted some comfort food fast. The service was quick and decent, and it was affordable. Typical diner food."
1006,NsDyIG5-qJFt9QWsoZEPdQ,Looking for a quick good place to eat? Then I'd suggest coming here. I wasn't completely fond of how you get to the restroom. My daughter slipped on the non slip rubber flooring a few times. The service was really friendly and knowledgeable. Suggesting the club sandwich which I did order. It was a little heavy on the breading for me but I was able to remove that easily. It was a great little place. Ended up spending about $30 for a family of 5.
1007,Y-KhG3NTlyCbV5F44jK6TA,"This is a place where the nostalgia to tourists far outweighs its food and service. 
Employees walking out and screaming on their cellphones to tell another employee he better come back to work. He was out walking the block smoking weed. This tall skinny one, wearing a saints cap, glasses, and with a beard stank of weed when he showed back up. 

Explains why the wait was longer than usual. 

Waiter got my food wrong and they didn't make part of the order. 

Weed smoking cook goes out again, come back in smelling like he was snoop dog. 

Complete hell experience with my young son. 

They just dgaf anymore. Go to Frostop or some other place on magazine and avoid the line."
1008,NwwkL_lrCF1OuWYoMT0VOA,Great late night food. Love the diner atmosphere and the cooks and waiters are great! My favorite is the Rano's Omlette with a side of cheese grits
1009,sThBUraosoOulLYQ61S9Zg,"I like this place!

They serve melted butter in a syrup container which is cool.

Quick  service, greasy spoon, servin up comfort to all that walk in.

The burgers and eggs are solid choices, so are the milk shakes.

Oh when the saints..."
1010,uhoWFL2zAxy2tff9VqxShg,"Fantastic food and efficient, entertaining service this Sunday morning. I enjoyed a shrimp po boy with fried Mac & cheese as a side  My husband had a breakfast po boy with onion rings as the side.  The bacon in the sandwich was amazing. Our server, Louis,  was fun, accurate, and quick.  No complaints about food or service. Waiting outside in a drizzle wasn't good. Having no explanation of their procedures led to confusion. I recommend going there for a good time and tasty food. It's at the Carrollton stop on the St Charles streetcar line."
1011,fGIFmrxQpJ9yvD6WmUlFYg,"Whatcha see is whatcha get! 

When you walk in, the only seating option is at the counter, so this limits the crowds. Luckily, we were seated right away. Even on the 4th of July, it was nice that the staff were so welcoming and friendly.

We ordered the Mardi Gras sandwich and the grilled cheese sandwich.

Let me avoid any confusion: this place is not fancy and will not ""wow"" you with its locally sourced or organic food by any means.

However, it is exactly what you need if you're looking for a classic diner feel."
1012,lk1bZpJOfGRn8YII7c5i6Q,"I don't think I've ever had more fun eating at one restaurant. The vibe alone here gives it at least four stars.

A friend and I came here on a recent road trip through New Orleans kind of by happenstance. A lot of the other restaurants were closed and coincidentally this place was closing in an hour or so but they gladly took us in.

The Cameillia Grill is famous both in the area and fans of AHS: Coven as scenes of the FX series were shot here.

It's a small diner with a few chairs going around essentially the grill/kitchen. A group of guys me and the entire diner from cooking cleaning serving and hosting. Each one of them had a smile and brought an absolute level of customer service and care to their customers and they made us laugh.

Now for all intents and purposes, this is a diner. A no-frills, not fancy establishment. You're going to get hotdogs, hamburgers, french fries, and maybe a Po boy.

Since the meals are made to order they happen to get made quickly on the large grills they have. I ordered the sandwich that basically was two hamburger patties on a hoagie roll and it came with a side of fries. Not the healthiest thing I know, but hey it's vacation. We laughed as I eat my meal because we heard the guys working there talking and giggling. The guy said he never seen anyone finish that meal. Little did he know how quickly I would finish it because it was so good, and actually I could've maybe had part of another one.

Like I said this is standard diner fare. But it was so good. The guys who work here make it even more special and it makes you want to come back for more.

Oh! And get the pie, they are known for it!"
1013,IsUREJ73b21VHfuUQI7vVQ,"Simply an awesome place, bursting with NOLA culture. The unique seating arrangement allows you to chat and have a view into their kitchen. The food was truly great and all types of stick-to-your-ribs tasty. I had a simple hamburger with some toppings thrown on, the mac n cheese bites (wow, talk about hearty), and a chocolate shake."
1014,RWzZfEYsqYynK0iTIU_x3A,"Not Wowed by this place .. Rude host and wait staff, waited way to Long for waffles and Bacon shreds Lol....two others sat down after I had and they got their orders first..I know the waiter forgot my order I was watching..     Amazing how TV show can Make a place look good until you are there in person , Off my Bucket list, Once and done!!!"
1015,lXySJxK3j0gipx_AjFQhmA,"Camellia Grill has a great atmosphere and an authentic New Orleans feel. It is a reactively small place, with diner style seating around a counter. The service is prompt and very friendly. The food is inexpensive, but not always amazing quality. They specialize in omelette sand breakfast choices. Their burgers are also very good. I would recommend getting either of those two options. This place is definitely worth checking out."
1016,_xaxkD4hee6117Pt_fWtog,We sat outside on a beautiful Spring day.  The staff were friendly and the food was excellent.  Inside looks like a dinner. So you sit on a stool at a bar. Could be fun. It was loud when I went in to pay the bill.
1017,JoMWjNbU-JuMjyIKBOZwtw,Great atmosphere. Great service. Great time. Camelia Grill. AUTHENTÍC. Ask for Bubba and HE will treat YOU RIGHT.
1018,6sA1Ulo6u33PDa0tqvcMnw,"Camellia Grill has been churning out diner food for 75 years (1946!) and you can tell they love what they do. You can get breakfast until they close at midnight and while I was eating lunch, the woman next to me had waffles. The menu has a lot of options, but be sure to try a made-from-scratch milkshake and if you order a burger, expect the waiter to ask if you want it 'dressed.' Ride the St. Charles streetcar to where they make the turn for Carrollton Avenue, and get off...you can't miss it."
1019,3pTgrrQSYu6VB_sw0_ZH9w,"Ok, total disclaimer.  I've been going to this Camellia Grill since I was in high school (I was in the last class when Franklin was in the old building before we moved to the UNO campus) so it's been like 20 years!  These guys know me so well that we're like family!

With that being said, my regular is the dressed cheeseburger, chili cheese fries (which now gets rough because I'm getting older and the gas is killing me! hehe) and the chocolate freeze.  

It makes me laugh when I see tourists coming off the streetcar to line up in Camellia Grill but hey, I guess it is a New Orleans institution.  I just remember my first memory being there packed during lunch (in high school), eating across from my best friend on the counter, and then having to get my food to go because we only had a limited time for lunch so I had to eat my food in my Spanish class in the trailer! hehe...

This is my go to place after going out (which I don't do very often).  I've also explored different foods and really enjoyed the grilled cheese with bacon.  One of my friends really enjoys the Doc special (?) with the double burger on bread.  Plus friends have had omelets, waffles, etc.  I also enjoy the pecan pie...yummy! *sigh* Oh, and my bestie swears by the orange freeze, but he loves orange drinks so what are you going to do! hehe"
1020,d46I_lknlrWzB1OXTLn9PA,"A place you have to go to because of the history.  But, the food isn't that great.  Grits are really good, but the rest is so so."
1021,8lP1aNkyDyVwrFgi8yZMTQ,"What you will find here is some good down home cooking, some friendly and interesting staff, a trip back to a simpler way of life and you'll most likely get to know the people sitting next to you at the counter. It is very small and cozy. You sit at the counter like you used to at Woolworth's or the Waffle House. There are no tables and it does not seat many people so you may have to wait a bit outside but that is OK. The food was fresh, hot and flavorful."
1022,ajt14ao3f95lY_wIS7cyAw,"A fantastic place to get some good ole diner style food in New Orleans! The food was excellent, the service was superb, and the ambiance was everything!

Stayed open after IDA so we came a lot to eat. Would highly recommend to out of towners. Great spot!"
1023,rvQepaTWw0NJ2MwW9il-vg,Super yummy old school diner that is worth the wait. Lots of variety on the menu. Friendly servers and delish diner food.
1024,j8Y3Og7N7fU7NVlkjeXARA,"GET IN MY BELLY.

But seriously, Camellia Grill has the best breakfast food/burgers/late night/drunk food ever. Needless to say if you see me there in the wee hours of the morning, I might be working off a drink or two from across the street. 

The food is fast, cheap, delicious, and comforting without being a junky fast-food place like McDonald's. The waiters are great, really add to the experience/ambiance, and they even learn their regulars orders! (I kinda suck though because I never order the same thing, although the Doc Brinkers special is TO DIE FOR). It's one of my hubby's favorite spots. Doc Brinkers is a double cheeseburger on rye with melted cheese, and chili and Cole slaw on the side for you to top it with!!!!!

The worst thing about it is the line, but it's WORTH the wait. I wish they added more seats, but I know it would ruin the experience of eating at the counter like the 50s diner it resembles."
1025,tEyrfioZNtTHsNAtT5lQ5g,"We saw some great reviews and went there to try it. It was really far from us, but everyone said its a must try. We took a really long Uber ride just for a disappointment. 

Very limited seating, we had to wait a while before we got service. The food was mehh and not very hot. Service was really bad, they took a while to take our order, and we had to ask twice to get the coffee's we ordered. 

The coffee was not hot, we had to ask for cream and sugar, then they brought only sugar and forgot the cream. we got fed up and just drank the warm coffee and left."
1026,UuthR2CkatLYPnUVZMtaTw,"The Camellia Grill is a legend in New Orleans. Definitely the type of place I bring friends and family to when they come to visit. As locals, me and my family go there every time were in the area.  It's my favorite place to eat because the atmosphere, the service, and the food. When we walk in the door I feel like I'm stepping back in time to an old time diner.  The set-up is just one long counter surrounding the grills and it's decorated like were back in the 50's. The servers wear white dress shirts with bow ties like you expect to see in a diner. It has a vintage feel.  It's the time of place that the waiters call out your order to the back using diner lingo and they are always so friendly. If you don't know what to get they are always open to giving suggestions on classic favorites. They are perfect for late night, early morning, lunch, and dinner. They have breakfast food and a good variety of burgers and sandwiches. The food is cooked right in front of you, however you like it. I would recommend this place to locals and tourist. It's a new Orleans classic."
1027,5BgtPMdFJShyoShhUIRNjg,"I came here on a Monday afternoon around 11:15AM and had about a 45 minute wait.  It was worth the wait.  This place is extremely charming.  The staff are really fun and friendly and the food is exceptional for its genre.  Both my friend and I had hamburgers.  You can't believe how amazing they were.  I noticed a family that had just finished breakfast food coveting our burgers and I even over heard them ask their server about them.  They reminded me of some of the first burgers I had ever had as a child from a lunch counter.  It's been over twenty years since I tasted any burgers as good as they were.  Camellias burgers are even better.  If you are looking for an amazing burger, look no further!

Raye our waiter was so friendly and efficient.  Once you do get a seat the food comes quickly.  To drink, I had some coffee and a chocolate cherry freeze.  The coffee was great.   The freeze was amazing.  Good thing I had been running because I even ordered bacon on my burger and a side of onion rings (which I split with my friend).  I didn't have room for dessert though.  If you are looking for exceptional but not expensive diner food in a charming atmosphere this place foots the bill."
